<p>Just so you know, your article was posted to "Davidbena:Yemenite Jewish Customs" which had it out in the regular article space. Since your article is nowhere near ready for the main encyclopedia, I've moved it to a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SANDBOX" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SANDBOX">sandbox</a> under your user page. You can now find the article at <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena/Yemenite_Jewish_Customs" title="User:Davidbena/Yemenite Jewish Customs">User:Davidbena/Yemenite Jewish Customs</a>. Please keep it there until it's ready for the main article space. Thanks and if you have any questions about the hows and whys of me doing this, you can message me at my talk page which you can find a link for in my signature. <span style="font-family:monospace;"><a href="/wiki/User:Dismas" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></span>|<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dismas" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 10:06, 26 August 2013 (UTC)</p>

<p>This kitten is for having a great attitude and being willing to learn about the sometimes-strange ways that Wikipedia works. I think you are going to be a fine editor who will bring a fresh point of view to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Sorry you have been bit so hard by some of the editors. Some have abused you and clearly violated wikis rule of conduct. It is unfortunate that many who do this know better. Below is a post by a self described New Age editor with a bias against you. I verbally censured him on his talk page and you could bring his intolerant comments to an administrator for guidance on how to address his behavior. I am somewhat new also but know his stereotype is not tolerated on Wiki.</p>
<p>For a Bible thumper it may be very difficult to understand that the Bible is not wholly and objectively true. But as long as he keeps his faith in the infallibility of the Bible completely separate from his Wikipedia activities, he could be a good editor. Some years ago I did not know that one has to use reliable sources in order to edit Wikipedia, but when asked to consider it, I understood this is required from everybody and I complied with this request. For me, the decision was between complying and continuing to edit and quitting in protest; I was not willing to create problems through my edits. This does not imply that I lost faith in the truth of my contributions, but I have understood that they are required to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:VER" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:VER">encyclopedically verifiable</a>. And verifiable means having <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SOURCES" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SOURCES">reliable sources</a>.</p>

<dd>Yes, I think the timing was right. I have been so busy lately translating papers from Hebrew into English that I have had little time to engage on Wikipedia. The problem with some of the people is that they will say I am quoting primary sources, but when you quote secondary sources they claim that they are merely hypotheses. Then, they will try to discredit the contributor by hoping to find other faults with him, rather than stick to the issue at hand. These people do a GREAT DISSERVICE to Wikipedia, and stymie the truth. In my opinion, such people should be banned permanently for such attitudes. It is dogma that they're more interested in, rather than conveying the truth. <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 02:34, 3 February 2014 (UTC)

<p>It is true that Haparchi recorded a tradition that Ramle was Gath, and some other medieval writers recorded it too. But I don't think it is true that any scholars today (i.e. relevant scholars such as archaeologists) take it seriously. I cannot find a single example, including amongst those authors who mention the tradition. I looked at about 20 recent archaeology books and papers regarding Gath, which overwhelmingly support identification with Tell es-Safi. Can you provide a source for what you are writing? <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 10:29, 25 March 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply, <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">User:Zero0000</a>. While I am not an archaeologist, I do live in Israel and I have read many books on historical geography. I saw stated explicitly in the "Encyclopaedia of Eretz Yisrael (the Land of Israel)" that the ancient city of Gath is believed to be Ramla, before it was rebuilt in the 8th century CE. This view is repeated also in "Carta's Official Guide to Israel," all editions (to the best of my knowledge). Since I have access to many good books at the Hebrew University library in Jerusalem, I will further research this subject. Meanwhile, however, we cannot speculate here without sufficient proof based on epigraphic sources. Since some modern archaeologists are swift to claim by "conjecture" that a dig may have been the ancient Gath, it is only fair to mention the conflicting opinions. IMHO. One more thing, here (in Israel) Jews give utmost priority to traditions, seeing that often we cannot know about a certain thing or place without a tradition that has been preserved from generation to generation. <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 13:35, 25 March 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I don't much trust the Carta guide, as its authorship is unclear and its purpose is partly propagandistic. I've also seen some bad cases of out of date information. However, the second English edition (1986) does not mention the tradition that Gath is Ramle. What it says is:
<dl>
<dd><b>Gat</b>: "Named after ancient city of Gath, one of 5 Philistine cities located in area, but whose exact site has not yet been identified."</dd>
<dd><b>G'ea</b>: "Perhaps the site of biblical Gath(?)"</dd>
<dd><b>Kiryat Gat</b>: "Named after ancient Philistine city of Gath, home of Goliath, which is believed to have been located in the area."</dd>
<dd><b>Tel 'Erani</b>: "The tel was erroneously identified with Philistine Gath and was therefore known for a while as Tel Gath."</dd>
<dd><b>Tel Nagila</b>: "Believed to be site of Gath, one of the 5 Philistine cities."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I absolutely agree that traditions should be mentioned. However they should be mentioned as traditions, not as facts, and popular traditions should not be confused with scholarly consensus based on physical evidence. It is quite clear that there is little or no scholarly support for the claim that Ramle is Gath. I have sources that state explicitly that the consensus (though not unanimous) is that Tell es-Safi is Gath. The Jewish tradition in the middle ages means very little regarding the facts, since there was no continuity of Jewish occupancy there even in the recent centuries, and certainly not since the foundation of the city in the 8th century, which itself was a millennium later than Gath. Scholars don't believe the tradition primarily since there is no evidence it was a significant population center <i>at all</i> during the period Gath existed. It isn't accepted by many traditional Jewish writers either; for example the famous geographical text of Rabbi Yosef Schwarz says: "Gath ... the usual assumption that it is the town of Ramleh, situated in the territory of Dan, I hold to be quite erroneous.." (and he gives reasons). <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 19:24, 25 March 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How does one distinguish between "popular tradition" and "tradition"? It was a Rabbi of the 13th-14th century who told us the prevalent tradition in his day concerning Ramla. As for a consensus, there is none - not even amongst archaeologists concerning Gath. There is, however, a lot of speculation. A tradition, in my mind, is stronger than mere "speculation." There are no epigraphic records to show that the archaeological dig at Tel Zafit, or elsewhere, is actually the ancient Philistine city of Gath. In fact, in the case of Tel Zafit, its names suggests the very opposite. It was Safitha. I will, however, at the first available opportunity, further research this subject. As for what you said about Ishtori Ha-Parchi's tradition being mentioned as such, namely, a tradition, I think I have done that. What I hope to do more is to show that this is not just a fringe view, and that a "tradition" where there is a doubtful case ought and should be taken into consideration. Look up the word "Ramla" in the Carta's Guide to sites in Israel. As for your comment: "...no continuity of Jewish occupancy there (i.e. Ramla) even in the recent centuries," presents no real problem, since the place known as Ramla is still the old Ramla and hasn't changed. What we're really interested in here are the FACTS. Let's lay all the facts out on the table, whether they be traditions or conjectures. By the way, I know personally a very good Israeli archaeologist named Boaz Zissu. Maybe I can also ask for his opinion and references. Be well.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 19:48, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

<dd>Carta's entry <b>Ramla</b> says it was founded in 717 and has nothing about an earlier existence or any mention of a tradition about it. Anyway, we are not supposed to make our own judgements about whether particular scholars are right in their opinions or not, and we aren't supposed to judge what is the consensus or not. What we have to do is report what reliable sources say about the subject, and the meaning of reliable in Wikipedia is heavily biased towards scientific scholarship with peer-reviewed academic writing as the most distinguished (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>). The Ramle=Gath tradition simply does not have any support in that literature as far as I can determine, so we can report it as a tradition but not as the opinion of scholars. I'd be interested in what Zissu says (I'm familiar with his work) but <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOR">WP:NOR</a> forbids us from reporting his words on Wikipedia unless he has published them. <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 21:04, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, so you saw a different edition of Carta's Guide. In any case, the "Encyclopaedia of Eretz Yisrael" mentions the view that Ramla <b>is</b> the ancient Gath. When I go next time to the Hebrew Univ., I will cite both sources for you, and, hopefully, more. I have made no such judgments whatsoever about who is right and who is wrong, but only cited a source used by many scholars. There was/is a tradition that Ramla is Gath. This is worthy of noting. As for the other hypotheses they should be stated as well, as hypotheses. When scientific scholarship is divided, up and down the line, we must also fairly represent all views. For example, we also find outlined in WP policy what is called <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>, according to which: "Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the main space fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources." A tradition doesn't necessarily have to be backed up with "proof," but must be reasonably accepted as a logical and likely possibility. When Israel has a tradition, as there are many, we are not always able to show by proof that the thing/event is as it is alleged. Tradition is just that - tradition. While speculation is just that - speculation. Boaz Zissu has written many articles, but if he hasn't dealt on the subject of ancient Gath, perhaps he can direct us to others who have.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 21:35, 25 March 2014 (UTC)</dd>

This peculiar way of spelling (pronunciation) applies only to the conjunction <i>Qiryat Shema</i>, but not in a word like "reading of the Torah" = קְרִיאַת התורה, which is the correct spelling. One of the most renowned Hebrew linguists of our time, Shelomo Morag, has written on page 222 of his book, <i>The Traditions of Hebrew and Aramaic of the Jews of Yemen</i>, (ed. Yosef Tobi), Tel-Aviv 2001:</dd>
<dd>"The קִטְיָה pattern in nouns derived from ל"י roots occurs in the Yemenite tradition in forms</dd>
<dd>like פִּרְיָה וְרִבְיָה ,בִּרְיָה ,קִרְיַת שְׁמַע."</dd>
<dd>Of course, all this is only related to tradition. In the Eshkol edition of the Mishnah with the commentary of Obadiah di Bertinoro, it is always punctuated with the vowels קְרִיַּאת שמע - just as you have written. However, in the Mosad Harav Kook edition of the Mishnah, it is always written קרית שמע, without an "aleph." See: Berakhot 2:5, Sotah 7:1.</dd>
<dd>I have several facsimiles of manuscripts showing the vocalization as I have written if you'd like to see these. But, as I said, it makes very little difference on Wikipedia.

<dd>I have often pondered the same question, but I do not know the answer to the question. It is true that during the Jewish war with the Romans, the surrounding wall of the Temple Mount was made higher. So writes Josephus. But I don't know if what we see today are the same additions added to the original wall, or if they are merely a later addition. - <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 18:22, 3 January 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Dougweller" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Dougweller">Dougweller</a>, I am aware that the article isn't specifically about the flood of Noah, but about "flood myths," in general, which, by its description, should also include the biblical episode of the flood. The idea behind bringing Cooper's research was to show how that it coincides with the biblical timing of the flood, based on the Jewish system of dating. This is plain by reading the research carried out by Prof. Cooper and his co-worker.</dd>
<dd>Doug, I'd be very pleased if you could help me with this one, because of its vast importance. Of course, since <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOR">original research</a> is strictly forbidden on Wikipedia, at best we can just mention the research conducted by Prof. Cooper and let others draw their own conclusion.</dd>
<dd>There were many stories about an epic flood, which in principle has its foundation, since this was etched in their memory as something far greater than an ordinary flood of waters. However, in those civilizations where there was no writing script, the story was passed down by way of oral tradition, and as is the case with some oral traditions, these stories could have been embellished over the years. The biblical account, however, is a written account, made by Moses, who was the 5th generation after Abraham. Abraham was aged 58 when Noah passed away. The account of the colossal flood was still very fresh in the minds of the people of Abraham's generation, since not only Noah was still living, but also Shem, the son of Noah, who endured that voyage.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 17:19, 7 February 2015 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Johnuniq" title="User:Johnuniq">User:Johnuniq</a>, a good example of a "pseudoscientific" article on WP would be our modern-day <a href="/wiki/Astronomy" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a>. By knowing what it <i>is</i>, we can infer from it what it is <i>not</i>. <a href="/wiki/Intelligent_design" title="Intelligent design">Intelligent design</a> should <i>not</i> fall under the same category. The <i>Intelligent design</i> (ID) theory asserts that there must be intelligent causes to explain the complex and information-rich structures of biology and that these causes are empirically detectable. It asserts that certain biological characteristics violate the Darwinian explanation of chance because they were probably designed. Design logically presupposes a designer, wherefore, the appearance of design in our universe, or in man, is seen by its proponents as evidence of the existence of a designer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of the main arguments in the <i>Intelligent design</i> theory is the <a href="/wiki/Anthropic_principle" title="Anthropic principle">anthropic principle</a>. The anthropic principle states that the world and the universe are very finely tuned to allow life on Earth. If the ratio of elements in the air would be changed just a little, then many species would die out quickly. If the earth were a few kilometers away are more or less of the sun, then many species would quickly cease to exist. The existence and development of life requires that so many variables must be consistent with each other, so that it would be impossible that all these variables are matched with each other due to random and uncoordinated events.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, one of our renowned scientists, believed in <i>Intelligent design</i>. In response to a paper published by <a href="/wiki/Max_Born" title="Max Born">Max Born</a> in June 1926 entitled, "Zur Quantenmechanik der Stoßvorgänge" (Quantum Mechanics of Collision Phenomena), Einstein wrote on 4 December 1926: “Quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard. But an inner voice tells me that this is not yet the right track. The theory yields much, but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One's secrets. I, in any case, am convinced that <i>He</i> does not play dice” (see: private letter to Max Born, 4 December 1926: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000038009">[1]</a> Albert Einstein Archives, reel 8, item 180). Einstein’s view was meant to refute that there is Randomness (indeterminism) in our universe. He felt that natural laws could not be like the throw of dice, with inherent randomness or probability (i.e. the opposite pretensions of the <i>Quantum Mechanics</i> theory), and was averse to the idea of randomness as a fundamental feature of any theory. He believed that randomness could appear as some form of statistical behavior but could not be a part of the law, just like a pack of cards that is shuffled according to deterministic laws still shows a random arrangement. Einstein's view, by the way, stands in direct contradiction to that of another theorist, <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" title="Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, who believed that at the fundamental level Nature is inherently random, and which view he codified in his famous <i>Uncertainty Principle</i>. In the final analysis, it is a scientific dispute, whether our universe is to be seen as evolving from "natural causes," or by some "metaphysical force" that has no less a form of consciousness as we do. Whether that be <a href="/wiki/Aliens" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Aliens">aliens</a>, or <a href="/wiki/UFO" class="mw-redirect" title="UFO">UFO</a>'s, or something else, will be left-up to science to decide. Let us not be afraid to address these issues, and to give credit to those who are <i>avant-garde</i> in this field of research by making use of the applied sciences.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Just as many theories are disputed by scientists engaged in the debate, ID is no different, but stands on its own merits. One of the staunchest supporters of the ID theory is Lehigh University professor and biochemist, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Behe" title="Michael Behe">Michael Behe</a>. He has brought down several strong arguments through deductive logic how that there is still much left to be explained in our Universe, and that the ID theory offers an alternative to Darwin's theory of random or "accidental" evolution. Scientific articles on WP are required to show "scientific method of analysis." Proof of "scientific method" as defined above can be seen in the dialogue between two professors on the subject of Intelligent Design on this YouTube video, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luRGzVrr2Cs">[2]</a>, beginning from 11:57 – 20:46 on <a href="/wiki/Bacterial_flagellum" class="mw-redirect" title="Bacterial flagellum">bacterial flagellum</a>, but especially from 24:06 – 32:32, in which Dr. Behe speaks about the evolutionary laboratory experiment conducted by him. If you were to follow the arguments presented by these two professors, you will see that Dr. Michael Behe meets these qualifications of presenting “scientific methods” of analysis when speaking about ID. He uses scientific standards and methods to support his theory. Therefore, the term "pseudoscientific" in this case, for the Intelligent Design theory, is without question inaccurate. Dr. Behe's words are not merely idle protestations, but are and have been demonstrable with scientific (not <i>pseudoscientific</i>) research.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 16:59, 2 July 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree strongly, <a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">User:Tgeorgescu</a>, about your understanding of Einstein. I have seen enough of Einstein's writings or quotes as to suggest that he was pleased at discovering how our natural universe is governed by a set of logical laws (call them the "laws of nature"), but which could never have been had there been an "accidental" or "random" existence. It is, for me, as plain as daylight. Einstein was, however, misguided in his ability to see how God can concern himself with small things, hence: Spinoza's God. <a href="/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, in his <i><a href="/wiki/Guide_for_the_perplexed" class="mw-redirect" title="Guide for the perplexed">Guide</a></i>, already explains that God is sometimes at work through us.

<dd>Your link sends me to a web-site advertising a book which I cannot access. Besides, the author of that book brings down his own opinions, and perhaps the opinions of a few others, which are no more than a drop in the bucket. Scientists worldwide have many opinions, and many still support the ID theory. So, again, there is no consensus about ID, although there is a consensus in public schools in America that Darwin's theory of evolution should be taught. BTW: My wife's uncle is a nuclear physicist, who once served as Israel's Minister of Science &amp; Technology, and he, too, believes in the theory of Intelligent design. He happens to be a religious man.

<dd>The journal of the <i>National Academy of Sciences</i>, while indeed a respected publication, is published by an organization not fully representative of all scientists, academics or laymen in our world, though one could easily be fooled by its name. To suggest that man cannot fully understand the complexities of our existence without accepting the views of Darwin's theory of "random" evolution (with all its flaws and errors), and that he must somehow cognitively avoid making any inferences from his observation of nature (albeit close to him), this is to belittle the intelligence of man. Even the laity, as well as those not connected with the laity, many academics and scientists, as well as philosophers (old and new), have published works worthy of our commendation relating to <i>Intelligent design</i>, which only begs the question, why is their view treated with disdain? Why aren't the views of <a href="/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, the famous Jewish philosopher, mentioned in the article when he also wrote about <i>Intelligent design</i>? If an idea is true, it does not change in a thousand years. The idea can only be augmented. Are there no merits to this theory? Of course there are! Has it not been approached from a scientific and rational level? Of course it has! The current article on ID needs rewriting in its opening paragraph. Our first aim should be to define and explain the principles of ID (without bias), and only afterwards to bring-in the dissenting views, such as what may have also been published by the NAS. Let us remember that the ID theory is not only understood and adhered to by some scientists (e.g. Einstein), but by many laymen and common people as well, as if some things were self-evident. They also make-up a consensus. Nevertheless, the onus of proof does NOT rest upon their shoulders, since our aim is not to convince the public, one way or the other, who is right and who is wrong, but only to lay-forth the idea of <i>Intelligent design</i>, and to bring down reliable published sources that reflect that view (whether we agree with it or not), and just as the title of the article implies. I can write about Hitler's Nazi youth organization and its ideology without having to agree with that organization. It is the same principle here. Our job, as editors, is to give an open and honest description of the subject-matter, before delving into its peculiarities. The current article does exactly the opposite. It quotes four sources that allegedly call ID a "pseudoscience," but overlooks the other published sources that do not ascribe to that view. The article at the very beginning is biased, and points a negative picture at what is actually a scientific/theoretical view espoused by a vast number of people in our world.

<dd>So, that is your respected opinion. I disagree, however, with its insinuation that so far no sources have been shown to satisfy <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>. One excellent source is <a href="/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, and even though he was a Medieval philosopher, he speaks about <i>Intelligent design</i>. Certain scientific or philosophical conclusions, if they be founded upon correct and proven principles, do not change in a thousand years. Moreover, I have suggested a brief change in the opening paragraph which, by all accounts, describes with brevity the fundamental issues behind ID, without forcing a biased opinion at the start. The problem, however, is that when I made suggestions for improving the article on main space, I was inundated by anti-ID editors, and their replies forced me to reply which, in turn, resulted in me being criticized for using the Talk-page as a forum. Ask most people (who are not involved in this debate) whether or not I've made sensible and constructive suggestions for the improvement of that article and I think they'll answer "yes."------ Be well, <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 03:17, 3 July 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your summary of the anthropic principle above is badly mistaken. The anthropic principle is an "explanation" (accept it or not) for why all the parameters seem to be finely tuned.

<dd><a href="/wiki/Teleology" title="Teleology">Teleology</a> can be another name for "Intelligent design," but its scope is too broad, while most people associate the name <i>Intelligent design</i> with the argument of design in our universe, whether from a philosophical or scientific-theoretical point of view. In this article there is a need for balance. That, and only that, is what I am striving for. The arguments are many in favor of the theory, and those - mind you - which have been stated by highly respected personages. Newton is just one of them, the father of modern physics. If his words seem to be too religious in nature, we can take it from Einstein's perspective, who was NOT a religious Jew.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 05:42, 3 July 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are welcome. Incidentally, I have no intention of editing articles about this subject even though I am a qualified scientist (not in biology) and I know a lot about it. The question of how we can know if something is designed is a very good scientific question, but a large fraction of what is written about it is not scientific. In particular, I don't consider people like Behe and Dembski to be scientists; actually they are religious fundamentalists who have learned how to use the language of science in promoting their religion. They don't follow the evidence as scientists should; rather, they invent arguments against any evidence that doesn't fit their religious beliefs. It's a pity you don't see that. <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 13:48, 3 July 2015 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I agree that Dr. Michael Behe isn't a scientist, but only a biochemist. But his <i>only</i> point in pressing the ID issue is to show extraordinary order and sequence and, perhaps, "thought" in all our biological entities and processes which, in his view, cannot have possibly evolved of themselves. I've already noted here that not all who espouse to the design theory have an ulterior "religious" motive, although this might indeed be the case of some. It's more complicated than that. The simple fact is that science has not satisfactorily explained some of the phenomena of our universe, as well as of life forms on our planet, basing most of its modern theories on Darwin's theory of "random" evolution, even though scientists have not found an unbroken chain of fossil evidence proving that all life forms evolved from a primordial cell until they reached perfection.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 15:52, 3 July 2015 (UTC)

<dd>"Biochemist" is a subset of "scientist"; what I was implying is that Behe does not think as a scientist when he writes about ID. The very reason for the existence of the DI is religious, and the idea of promoting the religion using the words of science instead of the words of religion is a very carefully designed(!) confidence trick. Second, every scientist believes that "science has not satisfactorily explained some of the phenomena of our universe", it is why they are scientists. However the progress of science in the past centuries is due to a move away from the "we don't know why molten rock comes out of the volcano, therefore it is caused by demons that are living under the volcano" type of reasoning. Behe's approach pushes us backwards towards ignorance. <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 05:39, 4 July 2015 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">User:Zero0000</a>. I would say that Behe is more honest than most. He admits that in biology everything has either specific or multiple functions. Based on his observance, they show complexities that would suggest design. As a bio-chemist, he has every right to suggest that view and to show how he reached his conclusions. A theory, mind you, is an idea advanced - though not yet proven - but which has some logical foundation to it. There's no need for us to be afraid of the probability that the answer to the questions asked may lie in metaphysics. Behe's confidence may have also been spurred on by the simple fact that Darwin's theory of evolution has not yet been proven. If dinosaur bones have been so well-preserved, we would have likewise seen all the transitional stages of development for all species of animals on earth, but this is not the case.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 19:03, 4 July 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Darwin's theory of evolution has not yet been proven" is just your personal opinion, it does not establish any fact for Wikipedia, since you are not a reliable source.

I have only suggested what I thought would be constructive edits for this article on the ID Talk-page. I have also brought down reputable sources to show how these views are substantiated, and are not, as you say, "crank" science. But since it is a contentious issue, I would just assume desist altogether from pressing the scientific-theoretical side of ID, and just present it as a "philosophical argument."

<dd>ID simply means a pseudoscientific alternative for the scientific consensus in biology (namely that evolution theory is accurate). So, if you re-frame ID as a purely philosophical argument, it is no longer ID, instead it is the <a href="/wiki/Teleological_argument" title="Teleological argument">teleological argument</a>. To be sure, evolution is agnostic about the existence of God. So there is no contradiction between believing that God originally created the world and that life developed through evolution. It is just that the watchmaker argument is no longer convincing, as far as it applies to complex biological organisms. We now have an explanation for their existence which complies with Occam's razor. It does not say that God does not exist, it simply says that a specific argument is not convincing. <a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">Tgeorgescu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tgeorgescu" title="User talk:Tgeorgescu">talk</a>) 14:59, 5 July 2015 (UTC)

<dd>There's only one problem, and that is, most international websites which discuss the subject of Intelligent design, call it by its proper name: <i>Intelligent design</i>, since <a href="/wiki/Teleology" title="Teleology">teleology</a> is a broader subject. The <i>Intelligent Design</i> (ID) theory asserts that there must be intelligent causes to explain the complex and information-rich structures of biology and that these causes are empirically detectable. It asserts that certain biological characteristics violate the Darwinian explanation of chance because they were probably designed. Design logically presupposes a designer, wherefore, the appearance of design in our universe, or in man, is seen by its proponents as evidence of the existence of a designer.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 15:11, 5 July 2015 (UTC)

<dd>Your article is grossly misleading. It says: "The source of this incredible mobility is the microscopic equivalent of an outboard motor — the bacterial <i>flagellar</i> motor. At one millionth of the size of a grain of sand, this motor rotates up to five times faster than a Formula1 engine, spinning the whip-like flagella and driving the bacterium forward. Most remarkably, the motor builds itself by assembling its constituent parts. It's one of the pinnacles of evolution, and, from a nanotechnology standpoint, it routinely outperforms our latest man-made nanomachines." Instead of writing, "it's one of the pinnacles of evolution," it would have been better to say that it suggests intelligent design, since such structures in bacteria are used for motility (for obtaining speed and agility) so that they can reach their food source. The goal is to obtain a food source, but the means by which it achieves that is through a design in its structure caused by a higher metaphysical source (with intelligence).<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 17:31, 7 July 2015 (UTC)

Intelligent Design</div>

</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/William_Paley" title="William Paley">William Paley</a>’s watch analogy uses a basic argument which would have us consider the intricacies of a pocket-watch; all the fine components working together to produce movement. Most would agree that our universe and planet, or, for that matter, the human body itself, is far more intricate and complex in their design. Now if the earth’s existence was random, or man’s existence was random, meaning, the universe was fine-tuned to promote life on earth after many years of evolution, is it conceivable that in 4.6 billion years a pocket-watch could have ever evolve? Its probability is finitely remote. Yet, the human body is far more complex and intricate than our common pocket-watch! This kind of analogy is called an <i><a href="/wiki/A_fortiori_argument" class="mw-redirect" title="A fortiori argument">A Fortiori</a></i> (an inference from minor to major premise) showing how it strains credulity to think that our own complex human form can evolve of itself in 4.6 billion years or more. If a pocket-watch cannot evolve, which is far less complex than our bodies, how much more then is it impossible for our planet and universe and our bodies to have evolved without a Designer!</p>
<p>According to the book, <i>Evidence and Evolution</i>, by Elliott Sober (Cambridge University Press 2008), p. 120, Paley writes in Chapter 15 of his book <i>Natural Theology</i>, that "the eyes are so placed as to look in the direction in which the legs move and the hands work." The obvious explanation, Paley says, is intelligent design. This is because the alternative explanation is chance; if the direction in which our eyes point were "left to chance [...] there were at least three-quarters of the compass out of four to have erred in" (Paley 1809:269).</p>

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">User:Tgeorgescu</a>, as you can see by this French Wikipedia page on Intelligent design (French: <a class="external text" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessein_intelligent"><i>Dessein intelligent</i></a>), they give both sides of the argument, presenting the subject in a more neutral tone. They write (translated from the French): "Intelligent design is presented as a scientific theory by its promoters, but in the scientific world it is considered as a pseudoscience, for reasons that both the internal facts of biology and also epistemological criteria cannot be rectified (the proponents of intelligent design appearing to biologists as having ignored numerous arguments, the more notable of which being the <a href="/wiki/Falsifiability" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> criterion of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Popper" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>)..." I am, therefore, quick to admit that the WP article on <i>Intelligent design</i> should at least attempt to show that ID is viewed differently by different folks, and that even if it were not a scientific theory, <i>per se</i>, it is still a philosophical question suggestive of something else beyond what is seen by our naked eye, and that some biochemists (i.e. Michael Behe) and physicists (i.e. Albert Einstein) have entertained that notion as a real possibility, given all their scientific experience. Do you think that it would be possible for us to incorporate something along the lines of the French article into our own English article, and to admit that there is a <b>philosophical question</b> that has been the subject of debate (or of mere musings) by some respected people of the scientific community?<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 21:19, 9 July 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"but in the scientific world it is considered as a pseudoscience" seems pretty damning, and there is no real difference with "ID is a pseudoscience" (according to whom? according to the scientific community, of course). Pseudoscientists never claim to be producing pseudoscience, they claim of writing science. You have been repeatedly told to find a secondary source about Einstein and ID, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">original research</a> from <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PRIMARY" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PRIMARY">primary sources</a> (twisting Einstein's words) won't do. Do mind that a lot of folks who believe in creation (at Big Bang for contemporary thinkers) also accept evolution, therefore creationism and ID simply mean theological visions about the development of biological life, i.e. denialism of mainstream biology. <a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">Tgeorgescu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tgeorgescu" title="User talk:Tgeorgescu">talk</a>) 22:33, 9 July 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Fwiw--Darwin changed his mind about a Creator designing the universe before publishing <i>On the Origin of Species.</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eTfRotZTXI0C&amp;pg=PA431&amp;dq=on+the+origin+of+species+no+more+design&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIubTQ3qDjxgIVww-SCh3Z3gOK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">On p. 431</a> of that book he wrote, "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered." And, "There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course the wind blows."

<dl>
<dd>Natural selection is not new to the universe, but even "natural selection" has always been governed by metaphysical forces. Moreover, natural selection which Darwin did speak about is not the same as evolution.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 18:23, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem like an intelligent, informed person and literate in English. Yet, your response is incoherent.</dd>
<dd>My point is that Darwin, as a mature thinker, did not support the idea of any kind of intelligent design in the universe. At the ID article, you were saying he did. Do you see your error? <a href="/wiki/User:Yopienso" title="User:Yopienso">YoPienso</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Yopienso" title="User talk:Yopienso">talk</a>) 18:31, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never suggested once that Darwin supported the idea of Intelligent Design. Can you please quote my words, if I ever wrote such things? Surely there must be some misunderstanding. ID is simply one's observation of our world and universe and all life forms and their unique functions and reaching an upgraded understanding that there must have, without question, been a rational and intelligent being who planned such things and set everything in motion and is cognizant of the things in this grand "scheme of things."----<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 18:39, 18 July 2015 (UTC)

Even Darwin was using the very term to describe the very concept. To insist on making the article about what <a href="/wiki/Discovery_Institute" title="Discovery Institute">Discovery Institute</a> says and does, is as neutral to the topic as insisting that <a href="/wiki/Pol_Pot" title="Pol Pot">Pol Pot</a> solely defines the meaning of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a>. The fact that these facts are repeatedly deleted even from the talk page is evidence of culpable bias. <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a>, sorry, but you will not get anywhere with these guys because they are confident that their own POV is the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">wp:NPOV</a>.

<p>Is there an experienced editor fluent in English and Hebrew, who knows how to properly add the critically important supporting document and picture links presented on the talk page, to the article page? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ksavyadkodesh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ksavyadkodesh (page does not exist)">Ksavyadkodesh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ksavyadkodesh" title="User talk:Ksavyadkodesh">talk</a>) 18:26, 25 August 2015 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I looked at the <i>Abraham Isaac Kook</i> Talk-Page and I saw a long list of items that you wish to have transferred to the main article. Had you listed one or two links, I could perhaps find the time to transcribe them, but not the long list that you provided. I have other more pressing issues to deal with at this time. Besides, in one link you show a Public Notice that calls out for a Public Prayer (יום תפלה כללי), in the year 5695 <i>anno mundi</i> (1935), something that, perhaps at that time, might have been very important, but which today is not of such vast importance that it needs to be mentioned in the main article, in my humble opinion. Other links may, of course, be important to mention in the article.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 18:46, 25 August 2015 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks--please take another look to see the work which has now been completed--the list on the talk-page is now much shorter. To address your important latter point, the reason the public notice calling for a Public Prayer is of such significant historical and current importance is because it clearly illustrates the broad unity of the Rabbis who are seen to have signed the public notice, and how they referred to Rabbi Kook shortly before he passed away. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ksavyadkodesh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ksavyadkodesh (page does not exist)">Ksavyadkodesh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ksavyadkodesh" title="User talk:Ksavyadkodesh">talk</a>) 18:26, 26 August 2015 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In your last point, I beg to differ, since these public notices are common-place today in <i>Meah She'arim</i> (Jerusalem) and B'nei Barak, and they all carry sweeping support from the leaders of the community, but are soon forgotten after the event. <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 20:26, 26 August 2015 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I respectfully disagree, since in this very unique critically significant example, it is a matter of accurately presenting the evidence based historic reality, rather than hearsay and historic revisionism which some try to repeat. I think presenting and preserving truthful fact/evidence based history has substantial value, regardless of what is or is not common-place in "<i>Meah She'arim</i> (Jerusalem) and B'nei Barak." <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Ksavyadkodesh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ksavyadkodesh (page does not exist)">Ksavyadkodesh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ksavyadkodesh" title="User talk:Ksavyadkodesh">talk</a>) <span style="font-size:smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">undated</a> comment added 19:32, 27 August 2015 (UTC)</span></p>

<dd>Accuracy is one thing (and I have no disagreement with you there, on that one point).

So, does that mean that <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_nominations" title="Wikipedia:Good article nominations">Wikipedia:Good article nominations</a> must first meet the minimum requirement of "scope" (accomplishments as far as time-wise is concerned) before it can pass a GA review?

<dl>
<dd>There is a tab on that link regarding Criteria. But the short answer is "no", they don't care about a time frame, or even if you worked on it. All GA cares about, is if the article meets that criteria. And whoever nominates an article should be able to take care of any issues that might come up in the review. Also, there is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_article_nominations/templates" title="Wikipedia:Good article nominations/templates">Wikipedia:Good article nominations/templates</a> that will give you an idea of what reviewers are supposed to look for.

<dd>I will gladly revert, if I have made two reverts in a 24-hour period. To the best of my knowledge, what I did was keep the other editor's edit, but only added a small side-note which differs from all my other edits that I had previously made. Look again at my last edit, which differs from all the rest. If this is called two "reverts" in a 24-hour period, let me first ask a more skilled editor than myself if what I did infringes upon that rule.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 17:11, 30 September 2015 (UTC)

<dd>The revert was adding the line <i>so-called in that most of it lies on the west-bank of the Jordan River</i>. Zero removed that, you re-added it (first revert), I removed it, you re-added it (second revert). I am not actually opposed to including why its called the West Bank (though that isnt exactly the story, its more that what is now Jordan proper was called the East Bank and what Jordan held between 48-67 was the West Bank), but I dont think it should be there. Either way, as a general practice, and especially in this topic area, if your initial edit is reverted what I think the correct course would be is to take it immediately to the talk page with no further reverting until there is a consensus for a change. <small style="border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap"><b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nableezy" title="User talk:Nableezy"><font color="#C11B17">nableezy</font></a></b> - 17:15, 30 September 2015 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd>Can I ask you what the objection is about adding something which speaks solely about Palestine's geographical location, especially when I re-worded the sentence to read: <i>so-called in that it lies on the west-bank of the Jordan River</i>? Note that Zero was against my use of the words, <i>so-called in that <b>most of it</b> lies on the west-bank of the Jordan River,</i> as well as what I earlier called "forming <b>the bulk</b> of the land known traditionally as <a href="/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>." Note the differences in wording.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 17:23, 30 September 2015 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But it isnt simply a geographical thing, its a political history thing, and I would say that belongs in the body of the article in a section dealing with its name. And how far exactly does a river bank extend? All the way to Jerusalem? But really, this belongs on the article talk page, and the article should remain in the state it was before any contested changes were made while a talk page discussion occurs. <small style="border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap"><b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nableezy" title="User talk:Nableezy"><font color="#C11B17">nableezy</font></a></b> - 17:30, 30 September 2015 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, since the article is entitled "West Bank," it is only natural that we treat on the etymological meaning of the word, for the sake of clarity, at the start. You asked how far it extends? That, my friend, is something that the article can discuss in subsequent sections. By the way: When a text-book says on the West-bank of the Mississippi, the natural connotation implied is that the adjacent territories west of the Mississippi are considered the "West Bank of the Mississippi." The details, however, would differ between each region. This, however, does not take away from the general understanding of the word "West Bank."<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 17:43, 30 September 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, John, my question to you was legitimate, since I was always under the impression that a 24-hour period is <b>analogous</b> to a day, and that if a another day had transpired, as it did in my case, the edit would still stand. Take into account the time zones and the differences between our places. I live in Israel, but I am not sure where our co-editor, Huldra, lives. Are edit times posted in the GMT of the USA for all editors worldwide? I know that my first revert was made at night, and my second revert to Huldra's edit was made the following night. Perhaps I missed out on the time when she made her change in my edit. In any rate, I will be willing to self-revert if I have abrogated a rule of practice regarding 1RR.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 04:48, 7 October 2015 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for your message which I have deleted since I dont think it is ethically correct to share private correspondence in a public forum unless you have explicit permission to do so. Nonetheless, the sources suggested by Dr. Masson are excellent, and her argument and conclusion clearly shows why it was correct not to simply use the primary source's claim as a flat statement of fact. Going from the sources and arguments provided by her is likely to improve our coverage of the history of Mayapan - remeber however that the article on "Maya Civilization" is not the right place to go into detail about Mayapan so it is a question of how much we want to include there, and how much to include in the specific article on Mayapan.<a href="/wiki/User:Maunus" title="User:Maunus">·maunus</a> · <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Maunus" title="User talk:Maunus">snunɐɯ·</a> 01:48, 9 November 2015 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Are you sure your edits are right? Did you really think them over?<br />
Bait Natif is how the 1922 census names the village, and the lead introduces it as a Mandate period village, no more, no less, although it's obviously much older. If the defining Brits wrote it that way (the linked census page certainly does), why does it bother you if it's mentioned in the lead? There seems to be even some WP rule (not hat I care so much about those) that says, if it ain't wrong, don't touch it. So subjective considerations aren't an ideal base for changes.<br />
"Roman" road: are you sure? I don't know, but do <i>you</i> know for a fact that the road wasn't MUCH, MUCH older, connecting Gaza via Maresha/Marissa with Jerusalem, and the Roman phase is just the more recent and better visible one? Or that the generally so-called "Roman" road itself isn't somewhat earlier? I mean Yotam &amp; Yigal Tepper: <i>The Roads that Bear the People — Pilgrimage Roads to Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period</i>, where they show that at least the stepped segments are not Roman, but older (cannot read Hebrew, in English it only says "[Jewish] pilgrimage roads from the 2nd Temple Period", so anything from Persian to Herodian is possible).<br />
I was obviously very well aware that the gen. hist. of Palestine is not what's specifically needed there, that's why I basically only listed the periods. It's meant as a conscious invitation to fill in the gaps. Half-literate WP users tend to overlook the larger scale of time, if there's a "History" paragraph jumping from Biblical or Classical Antiquity to that ubiquitous 16th c. Ottoman census, they don't realise that there might have been no continuity there, that the gap is a millennium long or longer. Like "red links", who do help as invitations to add info, this would also activate some people - or at least some neurons.<br />
I took all that into consideration. Did you? Cheers, <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Arminden&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Arminden (page does not exist)">Arminden</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Arminden" title="User talk:Arminden">talk</a>) 21:11, 19 December 2015 (UTC)Arminden<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Arminden&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Arminden (page does not exist)">Arminden</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Arminden" title="User talk:Arminden">talk</a>) 21:11, 19 December 2015 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I am absolutely sure about my edits, as I live right next to Bayt Nattif, and I also have a modern map showing the area and where it mentions the road (regional hwy. 375) as being the old Roman road. It's also listed as such in the old <i>Survey of Western Palestine map of 1880</i>; see: <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Survey_of_Western_Palestine_1880.17.jpg">1880 map of region</a>. Of course, it has been paved since then. As for general history, I wanted to add more too, but it was suggested by a co-editor not to do this, unless it expressly mentions Bayt Nattif.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 21:21, 19 December 2015 (UTC)

<p>You didn't understand my question. I don't say 18th-century PEF explorers didn't recognise the road as being Roman. Sure they did, and did many since them. I'm saying that it is quite possible that it's much, much older, and the Teppers give a concrete, well-researched counter-theory to push it at least a bit farther into the past. Did you read their theory? I see that you take the sources you happen to have at home as the final word. That's unwise. Even what's available online is but a fraction of what's out there, that's why I am myself a bit weary of saying that there is no info for C4 - 1517. You may live at the very center of a village and not know what's happened there 5000, 500, 50 or even 5 years ago, and that's normal. Take it easy, we all learn more as time passes, from Einstein downwards. And forget the "occupation" word when referring to old history, you're living in what was at some point Judah, then Idumea (Edomites from the east took over), then you had Greeks and Phoenicians around, then Persians, Arabs, Turks, maybe Mongols... Goes for Crusaders at best. But your neighbour might have blue eyes and be of partially Frankish descent.

<dd>Actually, well-known archaeologists (Boaz Zisu, et al.) and Israel's Dept. of Antiquities, also recognize the road as being an old Roman road, and there are still elements along the road that haven't been altered in all these many years since Roman times. Tourists often stop there to observe the route. Here, on WP, we are cautioned against speculation (<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a>), and must only rely upon reliable sources.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 11:16, 20 December 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You pick &amp; choose what you answer to. Or worse? This was NOT my point, and I made myself VERY clear: YES, what we see is mainly Roman, but the Romans quite possibly? likely? extended or paved over a much OLDER road. So OLDER, not NEWER. Get the difference? Also, Yotam Tepper is very much a respected IAA archaeologist, it's not some Indiana Jones character, and has received good reviews on his paper. He suggests with thorough arguments that at least the stepped segments are pre-Roman. So no, you didn't address my questions, and it looks more &amp; more like I was right in my assessment of your way of editing. Or thinking. I started on a very kind &amp; polite note, giving you the benefit of the doubt and hoping for a minimal level for our exchange of thoughts or information. Maybe you knew of deeper-going recent research done on those roads, or of contra-Tepper research, who knows. Or of archaeological finds postdating the 4th-century finds from Kh. Shumeila or elsewhere. After all, the name was preserved since at least the Roman times. But as it is, this is not a discussion worth continuing.

<dd>My understanding of these words, כלי פריטה, is that they refer specifically to "plucked string instruments," such as the lute, the guitar, the syntar, lyre, zither, kraar, etc. Bear in mind, however, that "stringed instruments" can either be plucked by a plectrum, or played with a bow. The "kinyra" or "kinor" (Heb. <b>כינור</b>) was, according to Josephus, plucked by a plectrum, and not played with a bow (as in some English manuscripts erroneously translate). Today, however, the Modern Hebrew word, "kinor," means "viol" or "violin," and it is played with a bow. You see, the word has actually changed in meaning over time. Rabbi Sa'adia Gaon also translates the Hebrew word "kinor" in the book of Psalms as having the Judeo-Arabic meaning of "oud" (<b>עוד</b>), or lute. (cf. <a href="/wiki/Josephus" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Antiquities" title="Antiquities">Antiquities</a></i> VII, XII, vs. 3).<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 22:00, 5 January 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">User:Tgeorgescu</a>, on the contrary, those who espouse to Intelligent Design can see the real benefits it has to them in their knowledge and understanding of our natural world, since the natural world is not without its Designer and that there is "someone" (or "some thing") whom we can, both, turn to and look-up to. This can also be tested, insofar that many who have gone before us (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Abraham" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> the Hebrew Patriarch) had encountered certain revelations from the Creator of the Universe. Of course, other methods of testing the fallacy of evolution cannot be tested, since it would require many, many long years of analysis just to prove one little point (such as, if man can, by conditioning, develop saber-like canine teeth). This, then, would put that specific area of research in the realm of "scientific theory" that has yet to be proven. Still, we <i>can</i> examine the human body and reach solid conclusions that are compatible with science. If you'd excuse my rudeness or bluntness for this once, I'll give you just one or two good examples. Let us consider the human genitalia. Wouldn't it have been a striking coincidence had nature just so-happened to provide the male body with the softest of his skin in his genitalia (more specifically, the penis) which, by design, is meant to be inserted within the female genitalia (more specifically, the vagina), without the act causing damage or unnecessary pain? By the way, Albert Einstein is quoted as saying: “Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous” (In “<i>The World as I See it</i>”). Or, let us take two fetuses as another example, one male and one female, both who are twins carried in their mother's womb. Doesn't it strike you as odd that "evolution" would have, by chance, provided the female fetus with a wider pelvis bone in order to facilitate the carrying of children in her womb when she grows older, but the male fetus who is not supposed to carry children has a narrower pelvis bone? Consider that for this "evolutionary feature" to have happened in this way, it would have necessitated the mother who carried the child to send-off, as it were, two independent signals, or for the egg and sperm to send-off two different signals - one for the male, the other for the female, instructing her female offspring to naturally grow a wider pelvis in order to facilitate room enough in her womb for carrying children at some future time. "Evolution," if it exists, cannot see futurities. Only God can see such things and manipulate the human body to act accordingly.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 01:56, 11 May 2016 (UTC)

<dd>Standard creationist nonsense, complete with misquoting of Einstein the Atheist, and basic misundersstandings of science and evolutionary theory. Tgeorgescu is of course right that ID has not and cannot produce evidence. Evolutionary theory on the contrary has produced volumes of supporting evidence over the past centuries - and has indeed "predicted futurities" many times (that is what experiments do). <a href="/wiki/User:Maunus" title="User:Maunus">·maunus</a> · <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Maunus" title="User talk:Maunus">snunɐɯ·</a> 02:33, 11 May 2016 (UTC)

<dd>I beg to differ. I have seen the bogus claims of evolutionary theory, all of which (besides mutations) have yet to be proven. It is <i>still</i> a theory. As for the creation of the universe, there are more proofs than what our libraries can contain, and this, mind you, has also been corroborated by the personal experiences of many a people. The denier of the truth, I'm sorry to say, is <i>you</i>, but this is not a forum to discuss these arcane and complex matters. Be well. <b>P.S.</b> - as for Einstein, he at first was an atheist, but later returned to belief in Spinoza's God - a god that, according to him, created the universe, but who doesn't concern himself with the small affairs of man. I will show you the sources later. <a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 02:38, 11 May 2016 (UTC)

<dd>No, because "evolution" is a process and does not have a mind. Man however can predict futurities using evolutionary theory. And no, only creationists think that Einstein became a monist - he was an atheist fronting as an agnostic out of the good scientific sense of humility about knowledge. Spinoza's god by the way is not the god you seem to be talking about, but simply a way of calling oneself an atheist without being punished by religious bigots. I personally also believe in "Spinozas God" - because in so far a god exists it could only be the impersonal force of the universe which can only be studied through the natural sciences.

<dd>I adamantly disagree on both points, since no "evolutionary process" is so boundlessly perfect and self-rectifying so as to suggest that it was randomly put-together. The odds of such harmony ever happening, and of mere "nature" pandering to the needs of every living creature, simply strains credulity. It is without question that Albert Einstein tried to understand the metaphysical causes of our universe. He could be described as an 'Intelligent-design' theorist, although not exactly a religious man, and one who claimed to have believed in the "God of Spinoza" (meaning, a god that does not involve himself with the affairs of man). In a letter to Max Born in December of 1926, Einstein wrote in response to a paper published by Max Born in June of that year, entitled, <i>Zur Quantenmechanik der Stoßvorgänge</i> (Quantum Mechanics of Collision Phenomena): “Quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard. But an inner voice tells me that this is not yet the right track. The theory yields much, but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One's secrets. I, in any case, am convinced that He does not play dice” (see: private letter to Max Born, 4 December 1926: Albert Einstein Archives, reel 8, item 180). Einstein’s view was meant to refute that there is Randomness (indeterminism) in our universe. He felt that natural laws could not be like the throw of dice, with inherent randomness or probability (i.e. the opposite pretensions of the Quantum Mechanics theory), and was averse to the idea of randomness as a fundamental feature of any theory. He believed that randomness could appear as some form of statistical behavior but could not be a part of the law, just like a pack of cards that is shuffled according to deterministic laws still shows a random arrangement. Einstein's view, by the way, stands in direct contradiction to that of another theorist, <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" title="Werner Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, who believed that at the fundamental level Nature is inherently random, and which view he codified in his famous "Uncertainty Principle." In the final analysis, it is a scientific dispute, whether our universe is to be seen as evolving from "natural causes," or by some "metaphysical force" that has no less a form of consciousness than we do. Whether that be aliens, or UFO's, or something else, will be left-up to science to decide. Let us not be afraid to address these issues, and to give credit to those who are "avant-garde" in this field of research by making use of the applied sciences.</dd>
<dd>While belief in a personal God, Einstein may have thought was childish, still, in the cause and effects of our universe, Einstein did believe that this was ordered from God. Remember, Einstein also once said, "I want to know God's thoughts," and many similar things. Furthermore, as noted, if the principles of order were laid down by God, it is what Einstein was seeing when he said on more than one occasion, "God does not play dice." I have already noticed, long-ago, your well-written article: <a href="/wiki/Religious_views_of_Albert_Einstein" class="mw-redirect" title="Religious views of Albert Einstein">Religious views of Albert Einstein</a>. Proof positive of what I am saying, namely, that Einstein gradually came to a more enlightened view of God, we find that Albert Einstein wrote: “...I came—though the child of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents—to a deep religiousness, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of twelve. Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression. Mistrust of every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude toward the convictions that were alive in any specific social environment—an attitude that has never again left me, EVEN THOUGH, LATER ON, IT HAS BEEN TEMPERED BY A BETTER INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSAL CONNECTIONS.” (See: Einstein, Albert (1979). <i>Autobiographical Notes</i>. Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company, pp. 3-5).<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 06:15, 11 May 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>One more thing:</b> Remember that Intelligent Design is also a philosophical question, not necessarily a scientific pursuit or theory, although it can be too. In Jewish tradition, the human species has lived on earth for no more than 5776 years. Science is not infallible, neither is it unassailable. At one time they say that the earth is warming, but then they turn around and say the earth is about to experience a cold-spell, resembling the ice-age. You see, science can sometimes be correct on some things, but they can still err on other things. As for the age of the earth and our universe, these astronomical dates are by no means conclusive when you consider that they are mostly measuring isotope ratios which may involve alteration by important factors other than radioactive decay. There are many other ways that scientists have been measuring the age of our planet, or things in our planet. Some have used X-rays and CT scans in dating things such as teeth. Mummies were examined by using radioactive isotopes of carbon to determine their ages. Isotopes are variations of elements with different numbers of neutrons. But what are the criteria being used to ascertain that their calculations are accurate? Scientists won't tell you that, but the uneducated simply believe their "highly suspect" results. Radiometric dating is, in my view, being wrongly interpreted, based on some false premise or unknown variables to science.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 06:36, 11 May 2016 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A thesis could be theologically or philosophically "true" without making it good science. Any scientific theory could change, if evidence so requires. All the evidence scientists have suggests that the Earth and life are billions years old. Of course, that could change if better evidence emerges. But a theological claim does not amount to evidence for scientists, there are other grounds for the justification of scientific theories. <a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">Tgeorgescu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tgeorgescu" title="User talk:Tgeorgescu">talk</a>) 00:26, 13 May 2016 (UTC)

<dd>True. But some who are the staunchest proponents and supporters of scientific knowledge have been rash to conclude that <i>Intelligent Design</i> is not a science at all, without letting the scientific method of analysis prove itself or run its full-course. They also dismiss the testimonies of men who claim to have communicated with the Creator of the Universe and say that He was also responsive to them. Why deny consciousness and the metaphysical? If we, who are but dust, have a conscious, is it hard to perceive that the logic and order that we see all around us and in our universe came into being by a higher form of consciousness that exists permanently? Of course not! You see, to ignore the fact that design is evident in all things, and to say to inquisitive humans that they cannot pursue this metaphysical lead, puts ignorance on a pedestal.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 01:11, 13 May 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">User:Tgeorgescu</a>, I have found that scientists and academics can be the most skeptical people in the world. Even when the conclusion to which the large body of evidence irresistibly leads cannot be supplanted by mere theory, they tend to still be great skeptics. A case in point: the creation of all life forms on our planet earth, rather than their merely evolving, or springing-up from some random existence. Have you considered that among our feathered friends, the birds, their downy plumes keep their bodies warm in the cold winter days and nights. If, let's say, their bodies sent out signals to produce such plumage in order to survive in such harsh winter conditions, why then has man not developed the same downy plumage on his body when he and his children, and his children's children for many generations, have lived in the cold regions of the Siberian tundra in the far northern hemisphere? It is because man has been created with a highly developed mind, capable of making clothes and shelter for himself to keep him and his family warm.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 12:23, 22 December 2016 (UTC)</p>

The question of how it was created is another matter, and here I go with mainstream science instead of pseudoscientific speculation. <a href="/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">Tgeorgescu</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tgeorgescu" title="User talk:Tgeorgescu">talk</a>) 21:19, 22 December 2016 (UTC)

<dd>For a moment, I forgot that you believed in God, because, after all, it was you who questioned some of my thoughts on "Intelligent Design" in my User-Page. So, I'm sorry if I misunderstood you. As for how God created everything, to us humans it is still a deep mystery. Sometimes science, I mean the critical mind of science and how they try to understand our physical world, but ignore the admixture of a spiritual component which exists side-by-side with the physical component in our world, actually does more harm than good, and can actually distance people from their faith in God. Taking the current scientific approach will never lead to a full understanding of how God created our universe and all life forms. We say in Hebrew that God purposely conceals much of what there is to know by the corporeality of our world. In fact, in the Hebrew tongue, the word for "world" (Heb. <b>עולם</b>) and "hidden" (Heb. <b>עלם</b>) are from the same basic root.

<p>Hi! Thanks for your edits to Roger Craig.

<p>Dear Mr Bena,</p>
<p>I have a book "The Story of Hebrew" appearing in 2017 (besha'ah tovah) with Princeton Univ. Press and I was interested in using the image you posted at <a class="external free" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_Supralinear_Punctuation,_from_Yemenite_Siddur,_April_2015.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Babylonian_Supralinear_Punctuation,_from_Yemenite_Siddur,_April_2015.jpg</a></p>
<p>But a query: You state on the page: "Previously published: A facsimile was later made of the original handwritten MS. in Israel" My editors need to know whether you or someone else hold copyright. Where was it previously published? And who owns the handwritten MS?</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help and kol tuv,</p>

<dd>Professor Lewis Glinert, thanks for your query. As for the scan, this Siddur is a facsimile of a copy of Rabbi Yihye Bashiri's "Tiklal Bashiri" (17th century), the copy of which was written in Yemen in the 1930s. The facsimile of this late copy was published here, in Jerusalem Israel in 1964 by Mr. Yosef Ḥubārah under the name "Sefer Ha-Tiklāl" (Tiklal Qadmonim). I am not certain if Mr. Hubarah is still alive, but I will try to check this information for you.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 22:01, 2 August 2016 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. The <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Asia/The_10,000_Challenge" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Asia/The 10,000 Challenge">Wikipedia:WikiProject Asia/The 10,000 Challenge</a> has recently started, based on the UK/Ireland <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:The_10,000_Challenge" title="Wikipedia:The 10,000 Challenge">Wikipedia:The 10,000 Challenge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Africa/The_10,000_Challenge" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Africa/The 10,000 Challenge">Wikipedia:WikiProject Africa/The 10,000 Challenge</a>. The idea is not to record every minor edit, but to create a momentum to motivate editors to produce good content improvements and creations and inspire people to work on more countries than they might otherwise work on. There's also the possibility of establishing smaller country or regional challenges for places like South East Asia, Japan/China or India etc, much like <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:The_1000_Challenge_(Nordic)" title="Wikipedia:The 1000 Challenge (Nordic)">Wikipedia:The 1000 Challenge (Nordic)</a>. For this to really work we need diversity and exciting content and editors from a broad range of countries regularly contributing. At some stage we hope to run some contests to benefit Asian content, a destubathon perhaps, aimed at reducing the stub count would be a good place to start, based on the current <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Africa/The_Africa_Destubathon" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Africa/The Africa Destubathon">Wikipedia:WikiProject Africa/The Africa Destubathon</a> which has produced near 200 articles in just three days. If you would like to see this happening for Asia, and see potential in this attracting more interest and editors for the country/countries you work on please sign up and being contributing to the challenge! This is a way we can target every country of Asia, and steadily vastly improve the encyclopedia. We need numbers to make this work so consider signing up as a participant!

<p>Hi, Please stop adding identifications from a 1932 source. While many of them are still accepted 85 years later, many are not. Old sources from before almost all archaeological investigation was performed cannot be regarded as reliable today. Also, there were no such things as "Israeli archaeologists" in 1932. <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 02:58, 22 February 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, can we simply change the text to read "Archaeoligists"? My understanding of the source quoted is that it is still a viable identification of the site specifically mentioned by me.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You got me inspired to do some work on the article, particularly ensuring that content is properly cited -- with citations that mention Palmer Park (vs. general links of Colorado flora, for instance).

Thanks for your <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Good Faith</a> attempt at improving this Wiki article. I am a former resident of Colorado Springs, Colorado, and I am very familiar with its natural vegetation. You have basically given only generic names of fauna and flora. The only "scrub oak" that is native to Colorado Springs is Gambel oak (<a href="/wiki/Quercus_gambelii" title="Quercus gambelii">Quercus gambelii</a>), therefore, its specific taxonomic name should be mentioned in the article. Likewise, the only deer native to Colorado Springs and the Front Range area is the Mule deer (<a href="/wiki/Odocoileus_hemionus" class="mw-redirect" title="Odocoileus hemionus">Odocoileus hemionus</a>), therefore, its specific taxonomic name should also be mentioned in the article. The cross-references that I provided previously mentioned specifically these plants and animals in relation to Colorado's Front Range. Without being specific in these particular references to plants and wildlife, the article is lacking. The prickly pear cactus (<a href="/wiki/Opuntia_macrorhiza" title="Opuntia macrorhiza">Opuntia macrorhiza</a>) is also very common in the Colorado Springs area, and so I am surprised that you deleted its mention.

<dd>Hi, Thanks, and I am very familiar with the park as well. The point is, that the sources need to tie these items to Palmer Park. I used the terms that were in the sources.

<dd>Thanks, Carole. It already looks better. Palmer Park is not an isolated ecosystem in Colorado Springs, but is part of the whole ecosystem along Colorado's Front Range. Here is where common-sense takes over when assessing source-materials. There is no infringement on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a> when one finds materials suggestive of wildlife and flora that either live or grow along Colorado's Front Range, and recognizes that the source also applies to Colorado Springs' Palmer Park.

I was reading through the book, "A Survey of Palestine," and I saw where the British were under much pressure and constraints from the Arabs of the country. In fact, whenever the British sent out surveying parties to survey the land, they were often suspected of surveying the land in order to sell it to immigrant Jews, and they were physically attacked by the local Arabs. There was a strong anti-Zionist backlash and the Arabs wanting to prevent land sales to Jews. These facts come out elsewhere in the document.

<p>David, neither Allar nor Beit Nattif were close to the Green Line. They were both around 5km away. Also, the Israel-Jordan armistice agreement was replaced by the 1994 peace treaty; it was not dissolved in 1967. I don't understand why you added the maps either.

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a>, The "<a href="/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)" title="Green Line (Israel)">Green line</a>" is another word for the "Demarcation line" between Israel and Jordan, also known as the "cease-fire line." All towns and villages captured by Israel during the <a href="/wiki/1948_Arab-Israeli_War" class="mw-redirect" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a> (e.g. Beit Nettif, Allar, Deir Abban, etc.) and which were to the west of the "Green-line," they came under the terms of the Israeli-Jordanian armistice agreement. This has absolutely nothing to do with the distance these towns were actually located from the "Green-line," but rather, that they were formerly contended by the Arabs for control, but came under Israeli control immediately following the war in 1948 and after the signing of the Armistice Agreement in 1949. As for the first map, I could find no better map, although it is still legible. "Beit Nettif" and "Allar" are both mentioned in the map. The "Green-line" is also shown in the map. All towns to the left of the "Green-line" (i.e. West of the "Green-line") and which were formerly contended by the Arabs for control, after the Armistice Agreement in 1949, they "officially" came under Israeli-control. The <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a> of 1967 cancelled the 1949 Armistice Agreement between Israel and Jordan, and the situation remained so until other implements were made between the Palestinians and Israel.

<dd>I know what the Green Line is. Your last sentence indicates that you have a misconception about these two places. They are not in "Area C", they are in Israel proper. I.e. they are in the part that has been under Israeli control continuously since 1948. The war of 1967 had no effect on these two locations at all. Area C is entirely within the West Bank, i.e right (east) of the green line but these are left (west) of the green line. You are also wrong about the armistice agreement, but anyway it is irrelevant here. <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 13:14, 26 May 2017 (UTC)

All subsequent agreements signed between Israel and the <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_Authority" class="mw-redirect" title="Palestinian Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> have nothing to do with the 1949 Armistice Agreements, other than the fact that, like the Armistice Agreement of 1949, these new agreements tried to fill-up the void and to give some sense of political order out of the situation where Palestinian-Arabs felt disenfranchised. How can you say that the 1949 Armistice Agreement between Israel and Jordan was still in force, when one of the stipulations of the Armistice Agreement was "No aggressive action by the armed forces - land, sea, or air - of either Party shall be undertaken, planned, or threatened against the people or the armed forces of the other"?????<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 14:11, 26 May 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Armistice agreements (like all bilateral treaties) can be violated, but they are not dissolved unless the parties replace them or agree to withdraw from them. The Green Line is still in place in Israeli law today with profound implications. If I commit a crime at the ruins of Allar, I will be arrested by police and taken before a civil court where I have the right to see the evidence against me, to cross-examine witnesses, etc. If I first walk 7km south and then commit the crime, I will be arrested by soldiers and taken before a military court where my rights are negligible. It won't do me any good to argue that the Green Line was dissolved in 1967. <a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Zero0000" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 05:00, 27 May 2017 (UTC)

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Zero0000" title="User:Zero0000">My friend</a>, that is incorrect. If, however, Israel and Jordan had signed another Agreement after the Six-Day War, you would be correct, in that the second Agreement would automatically cancel the first. Still, no country needs to formerly cancel a treaty for it to be cancelled. Israel viewed the treaty as null-and-void after the Six-Day War, as did Jordan. In fact, the entire Demarcation lines changed, in Israel's view, after the Six-Day War. In Hebrew-Aramaic, we have a saying, which I will do my best to translate for you into English. It says, "If the terms of the testament have been cancelled in part, it is deemed as cancelled altogether!" (<b>כל דייתיקי דבטלה מקצת בטלה כולה</b>) - Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 2:6). But why ask me? You can ask any Israeli who is politically savvy, any Israeli politician, any Israeli military expert, even the Israeli Ambassador to Washington. You can ask any smart Jordanian about their country's view of the 1949 Armistice Agreement after the Six-Day War in 1967. I am astonished that you cannot see what others see in regards to the defunct 1949 Armistice Agreement between Israel and Jordan. If this treaty/agreement were still binding up until the time of the Oslo-Accords in 1994, as you propose, then it would be possible to go around making treaties with any nation or individual, later unilaterally alter the conditions of the treaty/accord/agreement at one's own whims and fancies and say that, lo and behold! the terms of the treaty/accord are still binding on all parties. It would be ludicrous to say such a thing. Furthermore, jurisprudence does not work that way. I'm not saying that Israel broke the 1949 Armistice Agreement. It was actually Jordan who broke it by firing a barrage of artillery fire into the Jewish enclaves of West Jerusalem. When Israel attacked Egypt in 1967, Israel warned King Hussein of Jordan not to enter the conflict. He responded by shelling West Jerusalem. This bombardment of artillery led to Israel’s capturing of all the territories under Jordanian rule, lands in the so-called "West Bank" of the Jordan River. With that said, the only thing that you can say has "vaguely" survived from the 1949 Armistice Agreement is that, after the Six Day War, lands taken by Jordan in 1948 continued to be recognized as the "West Bank" of Jordan, with lands conquered by Israel forming their territorial boundary (Zvi Dror, <i>Har’el - Palmach brigade in Jerusalem</i>, Ha-kibbutz ha-meuchad 2005, p. 273), in hopes of returning to the status-quo that existed before 1967. The continued recognition by Jordan and by Western governments of the "West Bank" territories was only a means to save what they could of the country that was taken away from Jordan, although, later, their designs were modified to the effect that these territories would be asked to be given-over eventually to the Palestinian Arabs. This is why they insist on the "Green line" which has no real bearing on how Israelis themselves view their country.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 20:37, 27 May 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>One more thing:</b> What you alluded to as being Israel's practice of upholding two diametrically opposed systems of civil-law and authority in the same country, this has its own merits, and has more to do with the ethnic nature or make-up of our society, and our wanting to ensure that the country remains in Jewish control. Yes, it is not a complete democratic society. Still, we have seen its precedent elsewhere. Even China has a completely different set of civil laws for people living in <a href="/wiki/Hong-Kong" class="mw-redirect" title="Hong-Kong">Hong-Kong</a>, as opposed to those living in <a href="/wiki/Mainland_China" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a>. A country is permitted to make its own unique laws, depending on its security needs. Israel is no exception. The problem is that Western governments, prompted by British colonialism, have tried to fashion Israel after their own western mindset. Still, Israel is doing its best to accommodate the Palestinian Arabs and to ameliorate their condition. But this is not saying that they are entitled to an Independent State on Israeli soil. For there to have been an "occupation," there would have first needed to be an independent Palestinian State, which there never was. Jews were also Palestinian citizens during the period of British control over Palestine, as also during the period of Ottoman Turk control over Palestine. The problem arose when Arabs refused to live peaceably alongside their Jewish neighbors. The only thing left for us to do now is to try and make good out of our co-existence, so that the Arabs can live with prosperity and security under the current Israeli State and its laws. Years ago, no one ever thought that it was strange that all Jewish kings, from King Saul to King Agrippa, ruled over other men who were not of the Jewish nation. Why should they think it now?<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 22:32, 27 May 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"no country needs to formerly cancel a treaty for it to be cancelled" — that's the exact opposite of one of the most basic principles of international law. If it was true, treaties would be entirely useless. For sure, treaties can become <i>effectively</i> dead due to changed circumstances (including major violation by one or both sides) but countries can only withdraw unilaterally if the treaty itself allows for it. As for the different law applying in the West Bank, please go to court.gov.il and see how the High Court of Justice treats it. The military court system in the West Bank, in fact most activities of Israel in the West Bank, are justified in terms of the International Law of Belligerent Occupation. That's the actual phrase used by the court, and when government representatives argue before the court they do not challenge this assumption. Israel has never annexed the West Bank except for East Jerusalem, so under Israeli law it is not part of Israel. That's why the law there is different.

<dd>So, you've never heard about a "breach of contract?" A breach of contract is another way of "dis-validating" a contract. It is the same here. The principles that apply in ordinary business also apply here. Of course, without a breach of contract, the contract holds-up as good. I was not referring to withdrawing "unilaterally" from a treaty without violating the terms of the treaty. It is no secret that the people of Israel - the right and the left, the center right and the center left - have two opposing views on this issue. The Israeli Supreme Court, ran mostly by the left, has its own view, while the current right-wing government of Israel has its own view. It wasn't very long ago that the Government of Israel thought about "officially annexing" the "West-Bank," with a clear majority to do so, but because of the backlash it would have received from Western, pro-Palestinian governments, decided against it, thinking it in Israel's best interest not to force the issue, but to keep the situation as a "de-facto" annexation. It's very complicated.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 07:18, 28 May 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Adding statistics, of course, do not constitute a campaign to "smear Israel." As for <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:IMPARTIAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:IMPARTIAL">WP:IMPARTIAL</a>, perhaps whenever our intent is to show that the more mitigated tone in indeed just, a footnote can show the conflicting opinions about the specific edit in question (even if it doesn't specifically mention Husan). You see, the word "occupation" of a country is being used here in its broad and generic sense, and clearly shows a political inclination representative of one side of the conflict/dispute (i.e. the United Nations), but does not necessarily portray the majority view in the Israeli government.<a href="/wiki/User:Davidbena" title="User:Davidbena">Davidbena</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Davidbena#top" title="User talk:Davidbena">talk</a>) 05:21, 2 July 2017 (UTC)</dd>

"Informal annexation" unsourced, as it is generally held that all of Jerusalem and immediate environs was annexed by Israel in 1967". I'm not sure but I suspect you misunderstand the rule. The "General Prohibition" is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ARBPIA3#500/30" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ARBPIA3">the 500/30 rule</a> which prohibits non-extended-confirmed editors from editing I-P articles.

Either call the page <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yemenite_silversmiths&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yemenite silversmiths (page does not exist)">Yemenite silversmiths</a> and talk about (only) Jewish artisans, or make the lead and the page mostly about the silver and put the material about the silversmiths into one section. (Also, the page should be called <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yemenite_silver&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yemenite silver (page does not exist)">Yemenite silver</a>, as this is the English Wikipedia.) Several of the references are bald URLs; these need to be fleshed out before the DYK nomination.

<p>Hi, David. You may have tasted these locusts, and the description you offer seems plausible, but in Wikipedia, statements must be supported with the citation of a reliable source. In the Edit Window header is a drop-down menu labeled "Templates." Choose your citation template and fill in what you can. A URL (or book title) and access date may suffice, so no need to strain yourself over all the template information.--<a href="/wiki/User:Quisqualis" title="User:Quisqualis">Quisqualis</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Quisqualis" title="User talk:Quisqualis">talk</a>) 01:24, 24 October 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops, hate to rain on your parade, but, for obvious reasons (when you think about it), WP cannot accept YouTube as a reliable source for information contained in articles. Can you edit down your recent contribution to avoid this problem?--<a href="/wiki/User:Quisqualis" title="User:Quisqualis">Quisqualis</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Quisqualis" title="User talk:Quisqualis">talk</a>) 06:55, 24 October 2017 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, Wikipedia permits the use of YouTube videos as a source, and since we're only talking about "personal taste" (and no real technical issue), there is especially no problem here.
