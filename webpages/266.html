<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Huldra">Statement by Huldra</span></h3>
<p>How is the above statement: "Each editor is limited to one revert per page per 24 hours on any page that could be reasonably construed as being related to the Arab-Israeli conflict. If an edit is reverted by another editor, its original author may not restore it within 24 hours" to be interpreted?</p>
<p>I have discussed it with <a href="/wiki/User:Opabinia_regalis" title="User:Opabinia regalis">User:Opabinia regalis</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Callanecc" title="User:Callanecc">User:Callanecc</a> at some length <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Opabinia_regalis/Archive_15#that_pesky_I.2FP_area_again..." title="User talk:Opabinia regalis/Archive 15">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are presently 2 different interpretations, lets call them Version 1 and Version 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Version 1: its original author may not restore it within 24 hours after <i>their own</i> edit</li>
<li>In Version 2: its original author may not restore it within 24 hours after <i>the other users</i> edit</li>
</ul>
<p>I can live with either version (both are an improvement on what we had), I just need to know <i>which</i> one is the correct interpretation. <a href="/wiki/User:Huldra" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huldra" title="User talk:Huldra">talk</a>) 23:17, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the example that <a href="/wiki/User:SMcCandlish" title="User:SMcCandlish">User:SMcCandlish</a>: as I wrote on the above discussion with Opabinia regalia and Callanecc: that is only if you revert late, after almost 24 hours. In effect, both Version 1 and Version 2 will, if there are only 2 editors involved, result that the new stuff is in the article about half the time, on average.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, I can live with both versions, but if Version 2 is the valid version, then I think we would need the addition suggested by Callanecc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I would prefer version 1, is that that is a <i>fixed edit</i> to relate to. Take an example, under Version 2&#160;:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Editor A inserts material at 00:01, 1 Jan</li>
<li>Editor B partly removes/change the material at 00:05, 1 Jan</li>
<li>Editor C partly removes/change the material further, at 00:10, 1 Jan</li>
</ol>
<p>...then what should editor A relate to: can A edit 24 hours after editor B’s edit, or is it 24 hours after editor C’s edit?</p>
<p>(In Version 1, it is easy: it is 24 hours after editor A’s first edit.)</p>
<p>I’m sorry to be so nitpicking here: but 12+ years in the I/P area has thought me that there is absolutely <i>no</i> issue so small that it cannot be quarrelled over, or get you reported, so this really needs to be clarified. <a href="/wiki/User:Huldra" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huldra" title="User talk:Huldra">talk</a>) 20:33, 2 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Ok <a href="/wiki/User:Callanecc" title="User:Callanecc">User:Callanecc</a>, thank you for your reply.</dd>
<dd>(And yes, in RL editors will battle it out on talk pages, or in edit lines: none of us wants to waste time edit warring)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(But, I’m trying to figure <i>exactly</i> how the rules will be interpreted, knowing all too well that the threshold for being reported is rather ......low.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, keep in mind that if B, or C, removes as much as a <i>single</i> word from what A has added, it would be counted as a (partial) revert...this makes Version 2 sound more and more like the dreaded "consensus required", which wasn't wanted by the "regulars" in the I/P area. It also open up for personal interpretation: say, was this <i>one</i> word removal important enough for it to be counted as a partial revert? And if D, E and F messes around with the text that A added, A must wait until no-one change it for 24 hours? Oh horror.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not like rules which are open to a lot of interpretation! I like rules that are <i>absolute</i> clear, which each and every one of us has to follow. And, Version 1 is such a rule.... Just saying....<a href="/wiki/User:Huldra" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huldra" title="User talk:Huldra">talk</a>) 23:13, 2 December 2017 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I once said, a bit flippantly, that it is easy to avoid all edit wars: you could just forbid all editing. Which is the way we are going. With Version 1, we would always, sooner or later end up on the talk page: there is a limit to how much damage/disruption an editor can make, if they are only allowed one edit a day! My BIG problem with Version 2 is that it is unclear...if there are more than two editors: what will count as an revert, and what will not count as an revert? I expect <i>lots</i> of reports about this in the future....And a lot of waste of time.

<p>The short answer is: if you revert after almost 24 hours, yes, then the new stuff will stay in, most of the time.</p>
<p>If you revert immediately, then the new stuff will stay out, most of the time.</p>
<p>If, on average, a revert is done after 12 hours, then the new stuff will stay in half of the time. Actually, this is much the same both for Version 1, and Version 2. However, lots of complications might ensue with Version 2, <i>if</i> there are more than 2 editors, and/or partial reverts, <a href="/wiki/User:Huldra" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Huldra" title="User talk:Huldra">talk</a>) 23:31, 7 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>I support <a href="/wiki/User:Callanecc" title="User:Callanecc">Callanecc</a>'s interpretation that "the original author may not restore it within 24 hours after the other user's revert."

<dd>KingsIndian seems to be making a point that's not really on-point. Yes, this ArbCom language is an "extension of" 1RR (itself based on 3RR). However, that in and of itself means it is not the same as 1RR; otherwise the new wording would not exist, and the decision simply would have imposed the same 1RR rule we're used to. This is different: "If an edit is reverted by another editor, its original author may not restore it within 24 hours". There is no way to interpret that, that makes any sense, other than "within 24 hours of the revert by the other editor". This interpretation has no effect at all on "regular" 1RR or 3RR. Since the intent is to restrain editwarring, not to punish some particular editor in relation to some other particular editor, the further consistent interpretation is that if A puts material in, B reverts it, C restores it, D reverts it, neither A nor C can re-restore it for 24 hours after D's revert. Otherwise, people can just email-coordinate an unstoppable <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TAGTEAM" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TAGTEAM">WP:TAGTEAM</a>. C becomes a new "original author" from the point of their own re-insertion, but it doesn't just erase A's connection to the material.
<p>The wording could probably be clarified as "<span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">If an edit is reverted by another editor, the same editor may not restore it within 24 hours of that revert.</span>" That would cover every instance. E.g. to continue with same example of rapid-fire editwarring:, if E restores, F reverts, and G restores, G's restoration is an edit, and B, D, and F cannot revert it the same day. If H reverts, that's an edit, so A, C, E, and G cannot restore the same day. Easy-peasy. The problem here is the word "original", which implies only A is subject to the special 1RR. <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — <a href="/wiki/User:SMcCandlish" title="User:SMcCandlish"><b>SMcCandlish</b></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:SMcCandlish" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">☏</a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">¢</a> &gt;<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>&lt; </span> 23:29, 7 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>May I remind people that this rule was simply a tweaking of the 1RR rule. In 1RR, a person is allowed to make 1 revert per day. This mechanism depends entirely on their edit time, not the other person's edit time. Therefore, version 1 is the only logically consistent and easily-understandable interpretation here. I have always interpreted the rule that way, and as far as I know, everyone else in this area has as well. To take one example of out hundreds, see <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive219#Nishidani_2">this</a> AE request, where the complainant, the defendant, and everybody else in the discussion works with version 1. Indeed, if version 2 was applicable, <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2000_Ramallah_lynching&amp;diff=794377622&amp;oldid=794326740">this</a> revert would have been a 1RR violation. Please don't change the interpretation now. There is no evidence that version 1 is creating any problems: if it's not broke, don't fix it.</p>
<p>Btw, there is nothing unfair about version 1. It slows down the edit-war, just as version 2 does. In the hypothetical example floated above, the second person can make a revert of their own after 24 hours from <i>their</i> edit. May I remind people that most consensus in Wikipedia is achieved through editing: often what is needed is simply a rephrasing which everyone can live by. If version 1 is unfair, so is 3RR, which is policy. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a> 06:02, 3 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The comments by Arbs are extremely weird. Everyone recognizes that version 1 is the current interpretation, used by all sides in the area. (Please find me a <i>single case</i> where version 2 was used.) Now, ArbCom wants to change the interpretation to version 2. Why? Who asked for it? Did anyone complain that the (tweaked) 1RR isn't working properly? What's the evidence for any such thing?
<p>I remind ArbCom that the original amendment process just wanted you to tweak the standard 1RR a little bit to get rid of the "first mover" advantage. Initially you capriciously added the "consensus required" provision, which was only removed after lots of strife. Now you want to capriciously change the remedy again. If ArbCom failed to write the original remedy properly, fix your wording to match the practice, instead of trying to make everyone change their practice to match your wording. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a> 15:59, 6 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having established that version 1 is indeed the current practice, here's the point. Nobody asked ArbCom to change the practice from version 1 to version 2. Why would you do such a thing anyway?

People who are arguing for version 2 haven't thought the thing through. Many reverts are partial. Let me give an example: Person X writes "A B C D", person Y changes it to "A B Q R" which is a partial revert. Person Z changes it to "A P Q S" which is another partial revert. This text is incorrect in some small way, so person X changes it to A P Q D". But this is another "revert" which "introduces material which X introduced initially". With version 1, all person X would have to check is that they make only one edit a day to the page. With version 2, the matter would be extremely complicated: they would have to check all intermediate edits which could theoretically have reverted any edit they made in the past and then wait 24 hours after <i>that</i> edit.</p>
<p>One surefire way to avoid this situation is to wait 24 hours after the last person's edit. But then some other editor can swoop in after 23 hours, so you may have to wait 24 more hours after that person's edit.</p>
<p>The whole thing is absurd. It beats me why people want to change a perfectly fine provision which was working without a hitch for the past several months. "Just because you can" is not a good enough reason. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a> 05:39, 7 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

And that is a simple example I coulhd construct in 2 minutes. I can think of many more elaborate ones. The point is the one I made in the last sentence of my comment: while making an edit, a person has to check each edit in the past 24 hours and compare it to all their own edits in the past, and check if any of them could be classified as a partial revert. In contrast, version 1 is clean and simple: if you only edit the page once a day, you can never run afoul of it.
<p>As for your "gaming" comment, it is a guarantee that every rule in this area will be gamed, or to go one level deeper: people will accuse other people of gaming the remedy (see the AE request I linked above, for an example). The remedies should be <b>simple and clear</b>. Version 2 is neither. Btw, this was the problem with the "consensus required" provision as well: it was neither simple nor clear.

<p>I think option-2 makes sense. Lets play this by a case scenario on case1 - suppose an edit is reverted 27 hours after it is inserted into the article - the original author is then free to immediately revert the revert - moving the article away from the status-quo? I don't think this is wise. The original author should back off, discuss, and if there is going to be a revert-war (not advisable for all involved!) - revert after 24 hours. If a 3rd editor comes along - he is free to re-revert if he sides with the author.<a href="/wiki/User:Icewhiz" title="User:Icewhiz">Icewhiz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Icewhiz" title="User talk:Icewhiz">talk</a>) 12:36, 6 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Version 2 is the most reasonable. Version 1 is simply pedantic and can be used as a blunted weapon. Further I'm under the understanding in the case of a 3RR that consecutive edits by the same editor count as one edit. It would seem reasonable that the same logic should apply here.

<li>My interpretation is version 2 - the original author may not restore it within 24 hours after the other user's revert. The purpose of this part of the motion was to replace the requirement for consensus to be achieved by making editors wait before restoring their own edit after it had been reverted. This was so it would be more likely that the two users would discuss it and (probably more likely/hopeful) that other editors will be able to comment (or revert if the edit is inappropriate). I'm open to amending the restriction to <span class="example bad-example" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #8B0000;">"If an edit is reverted by another editor, its original author may not restore it within 24 hours <u>of the other user's revert</u>."</span> <b><a href="/wiki/User:Callanecc" title="User:Callanecc">Callanecc</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Callanecc" title="User talk:Callanecc">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Callanecc" title="Special:Contributions/Callanecc">contribs</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Log/Callanecc" title="Special:Log/Callanecc">logs</a>) 04:52, 2 December 2017 (UTC)

<li>Keen on additional points of view from regular I/P editors, but for now, an unpopular contrary view from me: I prefer <b>version 1</b> for the reasons outlined by Huldra and Kingsindian - it's simpler, it avoids disputes over partial reverts, or in circumstances where there are more than two editors, and it achieves the same basic outcome of slowing down edit wars. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Euryalus" title="User:Euryalus">Euryalus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Euryalus" title="User talk:Euryalus">talk</a>) 12:24, 6 December 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>My interpretation is version 2. Basically, "its original author may not restore it within 24 hours" from the time it was reverted. While I think both would significantly reduce edit warring, version 2 does more to foster discussion.

<p>Note: On 3 May 2014, the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a> updated its <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&amp;oldid=606947133#Motion:_Appeals_and_modifications">procedures by motion</a>. These state that:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Appeals by sanctioned editors</dt>
</dl>
<p>Appeals may be made only by the editor under sanction and only for a currently active sanction. The process has three possible stages (see "Important notes" below). The editor may:</p>
<ol>
<li>ask the enforcing administrator to reconsider their original decision;</li>
<li>request review at the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement">arbitration enforcement noticeboard</a> ("AE") or at the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">administrators’ noticeboard</a> ("AN"); and</li>
<li>submit a request for amendment at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Clarification_and_Amendment" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Clarification and Amendment">"ARCA"</a>. If the editor is blocked, the appeal may be made by email through <a href="/wiki/User:Arbitration_Committee" title="User:Arbitration Committee">Special:EmailUser/Arbitration Committee</a> (or, if email access is revoked, to <span class="nowrap">arbcom-l<img alt="@" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-At_sign.svg.png" title="@" width="15" height="15" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/23px-At_sign.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/30px-At_sign.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="145" data-file-height="145" />lists.wikimedia.org</span>).</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Modifications by administrators</dt>
</dl>
<p>No administrator may modify a sanction placed by another administrator without:</p>
<ol>
<li>the explicit prior affirmative consent of the enforcing administrator; or</li>
<li>prior affirmative agreement for the modification at (a) AE or (b) AN or (c) ARCA (see "Important notes" below).</li>
</ol>
<p>Administrators modifying sanctions out of process may at the discretion of the committee be desysopped. Nothing in this section prevents an administrator from replacing an existing sanction issued by another administrator with a new sanction if fresh misconduct has taken place after the existing sanction was applied.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Important notes</dt>

<ol>
<li>For a request to succeed, either</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(i) the clear and substantial consensus of (a) uninvolved administrators at AE or (b) uninvolved editors at AN or</dd>
<dd>(ii) a passing motion of arbitrators at ARCA</dd>
<dd>is required. If consensus at AE or AN is unclear, the status quo prevails.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li value="2">While asking the enforcing administrator and seeking reviews at AN or AE are not mandatory prior to seeking a decision from the committee, once the committee has reviewed a request, further substantive review at any forum is barred. The sole exception is editors under an active sanction who may still request an easing or removal of the sanction on the grounds that said sanction is no longer needed, but such requests may only be made once every six months, or whatever longer period the committee may specify.</li>
<li>These provisions apply only to discretionary sanctions placed by administrators and to blocks placed by administrators to enforce arbitration case decisions. They do not apply to sanctions directly authorised by the committee, and enacted either by arbitrators or by arbitration clerks, or to special functionary blocks of whatever nature.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Kingsindian_2">Statement by Kingsindian</span></h3>
<p>[To clarify, I have described <a href="/wiki/User:The_Wordsmith" title="User:The Wordsmith">The Wordsmith</a> as the admin imposing the sanction because they have in the past acted as a steward for <a href="/wiki/User:Coffee" title="User:Coffee">Coffee</a>'s administrative actions.]</p>
<p>I am here seeking a relatively narrow amendment.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Post-1932_American_politics_discretionary_sanctions_page_restrictions">Consensus required: All editors must obtain consensus on the talk page of this article before reinstating any edits that have been challenged (via reversion). If in doubt, don't make the edit.</a>
<ul>
<li>Rescinded. The provision can be applied for individual pages at admin discretion, but is not part of the template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Post-1932_American_politics_discretionary_sanctions_page_restrictions">Limit of one revert in 24 hours: This article is under WP:1RR (one revert per editor per article per 24-hour period).</a>
<ul>
<li>Replaced by: <i>Each editor is limited to one revert per page per 24 hours. If an edit is reverted by another editor, its original author may not restore it within 24 hours. The normal exemptions apply. Editors who violate this restriction may be blocked by any uninvolved administrator, even on a first offense.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>In May 2016, <a href="/wiki/User:Coffee" title="User:Coffee">Coffee</a> created a template (linked above) which <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Post-1932_American_politics_discretionary_sanctions_page_restrictions">is used</a> on more than 100 pages dealing with American politics. The template includes a "consensus required" provision: challenged material should not be restored unless it has consensus.</p>
<ul>
<li>The template has been used in the past as a "default" template for American politics topics. For instance, <a href="/wiki/User:Ks0stm" title="User:Ks0stm">Ks0stm</a> says <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive220#Volunteer_Marek">here</a>: <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">FWIW, I only placed the article under 1RR/consensus required because that was what came packaged in 2016 US Election AE [template]; it wasn't so much an explicit decision to make it consensus required.</span></li>
<li>Some admins do indeed explicitly want to enforce the "consensus required" provision. See the AE request <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;oldid=812346576#Anythingyouwant">here</a>, and the comment by <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a>.</li>
<li>The value of the provision is, let's say, contested. I can give my own view here, to make it clear where I'm coming from: <i>it's a very bad idea</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I propose that the template to be used as the "default" for post-1932 American elections contain the amendment I proposed. The amendment is modeled on the solution used in ARBPIA, and takes care of a very common justification for the "consensus required" provision (see TonyBallioni's comment linked above, for instance). This is a much more lightweight, well-tested and clearer sanction. To be clear: individual pages may still have the "consensus required" provision placed on them. In this way, collateral damage from what I consider a bad provision will be minimized. If ArbCom wishes to make an explicit statement either way (either rescinding the consensus required provision altogether, or to affirm it to be the "default"), they can also do so.</p>
<p>See also this <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive218#Consensus_Required_restriction_in_American_Politics">AE request</a>, in which the solution I propose comes pretty close to being accepted, but somehow it never got closed one way or another.</p>
<p>The above text is self-sufficient. In the following, I make a case for the badness of the "consensus required" provision. People can skip it if they want. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a> 09:39, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>My argument hinges on two points. First, consensus on Wikipedia is mostly silent and implicit; indeed this is explicitly enshrined in policy. Second, any bureaucratic provision must prove its worth if it is to be imposed. I will now expand on each of the points.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do people typically handle disputes on Wikipedia? Some person writes something, someone else objects, the first person rephrases, the second person is still unhappy, a third person rephrases it etc. Talk page discussions are also commonly made concrete (and sometimes productively cut short) by someone using an explicit phrasing on the article which all sides can live by. To be sure, this outcome can be achieved by a schematic discussion on the talk page: people writing out explicit phrasings on the talk page, opening RfCs, polling people, incorporating suggestions and so on. Indeed, I have done plenty of this sort of thing myself. But this requires a fair bit of work and co-ordination, and a degree of good faith which is often missing among participants in political areas. All I am saying here is that <i>mandating</i> such a work-intensive and time-intensive procedure is counterproductive. Existing rules are adequate to deal with long-term edit warring: indeed <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ONUS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ONUS">WP:ONUS</a> is well-established policy.</li>
<li>The provision has never proved its worth, nor have its proponents given any measure by which its worth could be measured. Regardless of the claims of its proponents: of the provision being a "bright line" akin to 1RR, consensus in Wikipedia is often not a bright line. Besides, consensus can always change, based on new information. In practice, the provision has led to interminable and bad-tempered arguments (including, but not limited to, admins enforcing the provision), and essentially nothing else. For instance, in a recent <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive220#Volunteer_Marek">AE complaint</a>, even the person who brought the complaint under the provision thought that the provision is bad but, they said, since it exists they'll use it. Then come the retaliatory AE requests, making a reasonable <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;oldid=812346576#Anythingyouwant">argument</a>: a dumb provision should at least be applied uniformly. This situation is, to put it mildly, not ideal. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a> 09:39, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a>: Your suggestion seems workable (though see my comments below). It might be a good idea to look over all the pages (there are about 120 or so) to see who added the template -- if it's by Coffee or TonyBallioni, the "consensus required" provision can be kept. For instance, on <a href="/wiki/Talk:Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Talk:Supreme Court of the United States">Talk:Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Talk:Donna_Brazile" title="Talk:Donna Brazile">Talk:Donna Brazile</a>, the template seems to have been just added because it is the "default" template, and not because the page required special measures. I agree with <a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN">NeilN</a> that the template should be substituted, and not transcluded.
<p>In general, my view is that the circumstances in May 2016 were very different from the circumstances now, so it would make sense to add the "consensus required" provision reactively, rather than proactively; that is: start with a minimum set and add pages to it as disruption or edit-warring occurs. These templates are "sticky": it's easy to slap it on, but hard to get rid of it. But I leave such considerations to the admins here; after all, they are the ones who have to enforce it. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a> 18:52, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am rather puzzled by various comments in the admin section. In particular, I am not sure what the extent of the disagreement is: it does not seem to me that the solution proposed by GoldenRing or TonyBallioni is all that different from the one proposed by Sandstein. The proposal I made explicitly differentiates between pages where the template was used as the "default" (I gave three examples already), and ones where the admins explicitly wanted the restriction there because they felt it necessary. The latter category, I aver, is likely to be a small(er) set. All I am asking for is to change the default template; admins are free to use their judgement to impose this restriction on individual pages. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">♝</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">♚</a>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at the DS log, I see less than 40 pages which were explicitly placed under "consensus required" provision. It is absurd that more than 120 articles have the tag: this means that the vast majority of them were placed because the template was the "default" one. I already gave 3 explicit examples of the latter case. Besides, I simply don't understand <a href="/wiki/User:Thryduulf" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN">NeilN</a> comments when they say that "This would affect the many articles where the admin has purposely added the "consensus required" restriction."; I explicitly address this point in my amendment.

<p>This is in uncharted territory, given that I don't admin in Election 2016/Trump/far-right related articles and that one admin acting as a steward for another is also with little precedent. However, my own opinion, and one that I believe would accurately reflect Coffee's opinion, is that this Page-level sanction was never intended to be the default for APDS or one that could be accidentally applied. I do support vacating the provision from articles where it appears to have been accidentally applied, and forking the template so that the provision is an option, but the default template does not list it. I do not support vacating the CR sanction from pages where it has been deliberately applied, as that would be effectively overturning an Arbitration Enforcement action without a specific consensus about that particular sanction. <span style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:3"><a href="/wiki/User:The_Wordsmith" title="User:The Wordsmith"><b>The Wordsmith</b></a></span><sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:The_Wordsmith" title="User talk:The Wordsmith">Talk to me</a></sup> 14:05, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>@Tony - it's not a bad suggestion, it's just that Coffee sorta spammed that template to lots of articles and it was never clear if he really meant to add that restriction or was just slapping on the template.

<p>Can there be clarification on if the templates are authorized by an Arbcom ruling or they are just placed there because an admin wants it? If it's the former, then shouldn't this be a discussion for Arbcom, via an amendment process? I filed an amendment request a while back, they voted on it, and I changed the template to match the new ruling from Arbcom. If the templates are not backed by an Arbcom ruling, then that should be spelled out in the template. Right now the template points to Arbcom ruling to give them enforcement ability so the templates should match ruling of Arbcom and Arbcom is where and DS rules should go for change, not AE which is an executive action, not legislative. <a href="/wiki/User:Sir_Joseph" title="User:Sir Joseph">Sir Joseph</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sir_Joseph" title="User talk:Sir Joseph"><span style="color: Green;">(talk)</span></a></sup> 17:01, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_My_very_best_wishes">Statement by My very best wishes</span></h3>
<p>I agree with Sandstein, Bishonen and Dennis Brown. According to template, <i>All editors must obtain consensus on the talk page of this article before reinstating any edits that have been challenged (via reversion).</i> This brings a number of difficult questions, even for experienced contributors. Was this particular edit a "revert"? Should someone count only an "exact" revert to a recent previous version, or one should also count edits that only partially undo something? And what does it mean "recent"? What if something "has been challenged by reversion" six months ago? And it is prone to gaming. Does this include reinstating content that was slightly different from the content challenged by reversion (two words were changed as during a recent AE case)?</p>
<p>This restriction led to countless conflicts, unnecessary discussions and divisive complaints on WP:AE. Does this restriction help to establish good relationships between users? No, exactly the opposite. Surprisingly, it does not help to establish any WP:Consensus because people start discussing procedures (was something a violation) instead of discussing the content. Personally, I think that was the worst editing restriction ever made in the project. <a href="/wiki/User:My_very_best_wishes" title="User:My very best wishes">My very best wishes</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:My_very_best_wishes" title="User talk:My very best wishes">talk</a>) 18:55, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that creating any general templates for new types of restrictions (to be placed on a number of pages) is something very serious. This can and should be discussed on WP:AE to obtain <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> of uninvolved admins , as it actually happens during this discussion. Of course if the template will be approved by WP:Consensus here, then it will be used by individual admins for any pages of their choosing. But once again, this should be a discussion if the template would be helpful in general, not about any technical procedures or something else. <a href="/wiki/User:My_very_best_wishes" title="User:My very best wishes">My very best wishes</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:My_very_best_wishes" title="User talk:My very best wishes">talk</a>) 21:56, 30 November 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Most important</b>, all editing restrictions must be very simple and understandable, and not only to admins, but to all other participants (they are generally issued not for admins, but for other participants). This is <i>not</i> the case here because even admins happened to disagree about the interpretation and applications of this restriction, and not only during this AE discussion, but also during a number of previous AE discussions. <a href="/wiki/User:My_very_best_wishes" title="User:My very best wishes">My very best wishes</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:My_very_best_wishes" title="User talk:My very best wishes">talk</a>) 15:15, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>NeilN tells below: <i>Admins can choose whatever template/text to add when applying editing restrictions</i>. I am not sure that creating or modifying DS templates by <i>individual</i> admins to enforce discretionary sanctions has been authorized by Arbcom. Making new template is not just an ordinary sanction to be applied to an individual contributor or a page. This is something a lot more significant. <a href="/wiki/Template:Ds" title="Template:Ds">Template:Ds</a> (linked to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Discretionary_sanctions" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Discretionary sanctions">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Discretionary sanctions</a>) only lists templates authorized by Arbcom. I think every new template for DS (or any significan modification of such template) should be either approved by Arbcom or by consensus of WP:AE admins.

<dd>Technically, the template as such is not an appealable sanction, because it's just, well, a template for a sanction. The template's application to a specific article by an administrator is the actual sanction that can be appealed. But we can treat this request as a <a href="/wiki/Class_action" title="Class action">class action</a> appeal, as it were, of all such sanctions. I would appreciate it if editors who have followed this issue would ping, insofar as possible, all administrators who have used this template so that they can comment.</dd>
<dd>In my view, templated article-level sanctions are problematic because they do not take into specific circumstances of the editing environment of the article at issue. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AC/DS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AC/DS">WP:AC/DS</a> expects sanctioning admins to

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This requirement to apply discretion is not compatible with a one-size-fits-all approach to sanctions, which a template embodies. In some cases, the editing environment may be so toxic that a restriction such as the "consensus required" provision may be needed, but in many cases individual blocks, bans or protections may be a more proportionate response. The widespread use of a template containing complicated rules such as a "consensus required" rules will cause many technical violations of discretionary sanctions to occur in the course of ordinary and, in and of itself, probably not sanction-worthy content disputes.</dd>
<dd>It is best, therefore, to remove the template and leave admins free to individually (re-)apply appropriate sanctions to such articles as may (still) warrant it. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein"><span style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;"><b>Sandstein</b></span></a></span></small> 11:02, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reject</b> the template is not how discretionary sanctions are applied. It is a courtesy placed on the talk page. The actual sanctions are logged at the arbitration enforcement log. Additionally, users are alerted to them not by the talk page template, but by page notices. As the arbitration enforcement log shows, many administrators are willing to not impose these sanctions on articles if they don’t want to, so the complaint is really with the overwhelming majority of the articles sanctioned by Coffee. People like to bitch about these sanctions, but they work, and they are the main reason that the American politics field isn’t an even bigger mess than it is today. <a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a>, your suggested course of action ignores the fact that any validly applied sanctions were placed by an individual administrator on his own discretion (<a href="/wiki/User:Coffee" title="User:Coffee">Coffee</a>) and he has recently spoken out in favour of keeping the sanctions. If we vacate the “template sanctions”, I would personally go through the now sanctionless articles and likely apply the exact same sanctions to most of them myself immediately after the appeal was over because of how volitile this topic area is. There is no reason to waste time and increase the disruption on American politics articles. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 11:59, 30 November 2017 (UTC)

The fact that what it takes to get people to actually follow that policy is a discretionary sanction is ridiculous but it is the case.

Finally, I’ll note that what we are being asked to do here is give people license to multi-party edit war on some of the most controversial and significant articles to the public. I cannot support that, and it is what this amendment would do.<a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 12:11, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>I could get behind the Wordsmith’s suggestion. This should be based upon the actual sanction listed at the arbitration enforcement log. If it doesn’t list 1RR/Consensus required, remove the template. Keep in place, however, the sanctions if they were intentionally applied by an admin, and make it clear any admin can still choose to apply this set of sanctions in individual cases if they wish. Basically, all of Coffee’s page level sanctions should be kept as should any others where this was the intent. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 14:12, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Volunteer_Marek" title="User:Volunteer Marek">Volunteer Marek</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>:</span> it is unclear to me whether this would affect pages already tagged with the template (most of them by Coffee, who did place it intentionally), or just be a change going forward, which is why I am concerned. If the concern is that this standard template is not what most administrators intend to impose, may I offer what I consider a simpler suggestion: we substitute the template on the pages where we know it was the intent of the admin to impose it (so basically anything imposed by Coffee or myself, and those where the AE log specifically notes "consensus required"). We then take the template to TfD, delete it, and instruct admins to use the standard discretionary sanctions talk page notice rather than this bundled one. I think this addresses some of <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Bishonen" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>:</span>'s valid concerns while respecting that some administrators did use this template intentionally because they liked the bundle. If we are going to move away from this template, we might as well move away from any specific US politics DS template and require admins to think about what thye are imposing. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 15:55, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">GoldenRing</a>:</span> your solution is much more complex than simply substituting the existing template. I'd also be opposed to editing the existing template because it might bias people who would otherwise be placing the sanctions intentionally against placing them not knowing it had been changed.

<li>Because it leaves in place the sanctions that were intentionally placed by an administrator and keeps the same format that people are used to seeing on the article, making confusion less likely. Also, you are operating under the assumption that the template will be removed, which is unclear here. Substitution also deals with <a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN">NeilN</a>'s concerns that another admin can come along and edit the template and make it look like the sanctions were changed.

<li><b>Support amendment</b>. I seem to keep saying this, but I just don't like to find myself on a list that seems to imply (?) that I have placed articles under the "consensus required" provision (MrX's list above). I did do that, once, then came to think the restriction was too difficult to understand, and too much of an invitation to "gotcha" filings, and <i>removed</i> it from the page where I had placed it. I won't place it again, in the form that it has now, and I agree with Kingsindian's amendment. <a href="/wiki/User:Bishonen" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:27, 30 November 2017 (UTC).</li>
<li>As before, I don't have much opinion on this either way in terms of whether we use "consensus required" going forward. I do oppose deleting the template, since that just makes a lot of busy-work replacing it with appropriate talk page notices. If consensus required is removed, I'll replace it with the following sanction on all pages it's currently in place on: "Editors cannot restore edits which they have introduced within 24 hours if the edits have been reverted." ~ <a href="/wiki/User:BU_Rob13" title="User:BU Rob13"><b>Rob</b><small><sub>13</sub></small></a><sup style="margin-left:-1.0ex;"><a href="/wiki/User_talk:BU_Rob13" title="User talk:BU Rob13">Talk</a></sup> 15:51, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> changing template if it means modifying existing restrictions. This would affect the many articles where the admin has purposely added the "consensus required" restriction. Admins did not have to use this template if they didn't want to impose all the restrictions it listed. Also, any templates like this really should be substituted rather than transcluded to prevent one admin making undiscussed changes that would affect hundreds of articles they had no interest in. Finally <a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein's</a> proposal of vacating all sanctions is a non-starter. He assumes admins take a "one-size-fits-all approach" when applying sanctions with no evidence to back it up. A list of cases where <b>neutral</b> parties would agree that an editor was unfairly sanctioned because of the restriction is needed at a minimum. --<a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN"><b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:NeilN" title="User talk:NeilN"><i style="color:blue">talk to me</i></a></sup> 16:18, 30 November 2017 (UTC)

That is, you can't blame the tool/template if you're misusing it. Admins can choose whatever template/text to add when applying editing restrictions. The fact that some of them may not have read the template text as carefully as they should have does not mean extra work needs to be done by the admins that did. It's more appropriate to say in this case, "There is absolutely nothing stopping the DS-levying admin from removing the provision if they want to." --<a href="/wiki/User:NeilN" title="User:NeilN"><b style="color:navy">Neil<span style="color:red">N</span></b></a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:NeilN" title="User talk:NeilN"><i style="color:blue">talk to me</i></a></sup> 22:58, 2 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Grant appeal</b> per Sandstein. He said it best, so I won't parrot him, but the "consensus" clause has caused problems and should not be automatically applied to all articles falling under this Arb ruling, if any at all. I'm not as big into repealing all previous sanctions, but I won't labor it. <a href="/wiki/User:Dennis_Brown" title="User:Dennis Brown"><b>Dennis Brown</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dennis_Brown" title="User talk:Dennis Brown"><b>2¢</b></a> 16:59, 30 November 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm going to make the rare move of disagreeing with <a href="/wiki/User:Dennis_Brown" title="User:Dennis Brown">Dennis Brown</a> here, and <a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> in the process. It is clear that some admins have applied the "consensus required" restriction deliberately and oppose overturning it; and it is clear that many admins oppose overturning the restriction without putting something else similar in place (see the discussion <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive218#Consensus_Required_restriction_in_American_Politics" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive218">here</a>). Contra Sandstein, deleting the template does not vacate the restriction on all articles where it has been used; AE sanctions are valid when and only when logged at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DSLOG" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DSLOG">WP:DSLOG</a>. There appear to be a largish number of articles where the template has been applied but the relevant sanction <i>not</i> logged; we should not construe the restriction as valid in those cases.
<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>
Therefore, I think the right way forward is to edit the the current template to remove the consensus required restriction; to create a new and more obscure template that includes the consensus required restriction; and to apply that new template wherever the "consensus required" restriction has been validly logged. It'd be an hour or so of fairly dull work, I'm afraid, but that's what we have the mop for. I'm willing to do it. As far as I can see, doing so doesn't really require a formal consensus here, either, since it's not modifying any valid AE sanctions (though I'm not going to run off and do it now without further discussion). <a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">GoldenRing</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GoldenRing" title="User talk:GoldenRing">talk</a>) 10:20, 1 December 2017 (UTC)

Individual admins have placed pages under a combination of 1RR and 'consensus required'. These restrictions are authorised by the committee's DS authorisation, but are only put in place by individual admins. They are only valid when logged at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DSLOG" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DSLOG">WP:DSLOG</a>.

I would not construe this as imposing the restriction; sanctions must be logged at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DSLOG" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DSLOG">WP:DSLOG</a> or they are not valid and the template is only a courtesy note (in this case an inaccurate one for many articles). <a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">GoldenRing</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GoldenRing" title="User talk:GoldenRing">talk</a>) 13:52, 1 December 2017 (UTC)

<li>Which is why the template should be changed, so there isn't a template stating there is a restriction when one is not in place, as that causes problem.

<li>Yes, I agree with Dennis 100% here, which is why I think if any changes are made, it should be in the direction of getting rid of the area-specific-notice templates, and making admins write out by hand what their actual intent is so we aren't confused when it comes here. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 16:32, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Decline appeal</b>. I agree with GoldenRing, there appear to be instances where the "consensus required" provision was deliberately and intentionally applied and instances where it wasn't. Once the two versions are in place, I would be open to hearing appeals regarding the "consensus required" provision in individual cases where someone feels it isn't working, but not mass removal. I would also not object to an alternative being proposed to be introduced as a third option, and if that happens discussion of individually converting individual applications between "consensus required" and the new provision would be fine, but again not indiscriminately. <a href="/wiki/User:Thryduulf" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thryduulf" title="User talk:Thryduulf">talk</a>) 10:47, 1 December 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>:</span> There are roughly four options here: (1) remove the "consensus required" provision completely, (2) remove the "consensus required" provision but allow it to be (re-)added to articles where it is desired (as an option, not as the default), (3) change the "consensus required" provision from the default to the option for future applications and allow it to be removed from existing articles where it is not desired. (4) Leave the "consensus required" provision as the default or only option. I favour option 3, my understanding is that you prefer option 2. Creating an alternative provision has also been suggested but this is possible whichever of the above options is chosen. <a href="/wiki/User:Thryduulf" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thryduulf" title="User talk:Thryduulf">talk</a>) 00:10, 3 December 2017 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>I agree with the options, and could live with 3, although I also prefer 2. The primary point is removing it from the template so it isn't automatically stated that the article is under "consensus required", and allow the admin to add that for the instances where it is needed, or better yet, don't add it initially but only after the article proves that is required. I think the sanction is problematic under the best of circumstances, and should be used sparingly and intentionally, not automatically, if at all. <a href="/wiki/User:Dennis_Brown" title="User:Dennis Brown"><b>Dennis Brown</b></a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dennis_Brown" title="User talk:Dennis Brown"><b>2¢</b></a> 01:33, 3 December 2017 (UTC)

<li>I favour option 4 personally, 1RR is meaningless without "consensus required", and if I place 1RR on any article in the future it will come with it. That being said, I don't strongly oppose option 3 on a case by case basis. The reason I think we should go ahead and close this appeal is that what we're essentially talking about here are changes to the template, and not to the sanctions themselves, which can be appealed on an individual basis. Template changes can be discussed on the template talk page, and are not actually an arbitration enforcement action since the actual sanctions are noted at the log. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 15:14, 3 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>May I suggest that the next passing admin close this as no consensus to grant the appeal unless anyone has any objections.

<li>There's a solution no-one has proposed yet, which is to add parameters to the template allowing an admin to include/exclude certain sanctions. For instance, if an admin sets <code class="nowrap">|consensus-required=no</code>, then the template doesn't include consensus required. We could then have a real discussion on what should be the defaults (noting that it would take some bot work to fix existing notices if we want to change the default from what it currently is). This is probably the conversation we <i>should</i> be having, given that there's no apparent consensus to reverse existing sanctions en masse.

<dd>I agree.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_James_J._Lambden">Statement by James J. Lambden</span></h4>
<p>It is waste of time to file a complaint for a talk page edit which I suggested be discussed with the administrator who imposed the topic ban. My comment had nothing to do with Trump and the subject's association with Trump is <a href="/wiki/Talk:Patriot_Prayer/Archive_3#K.e.coffman_lead_proposal" title="Talk:Patriot Prayer/Archive 3">disputed</a>. According to our article "mentions of Trump have mostly been scrubbed from [the group's] rhetoric." If I am to interpret this topic ban as applying to every article that mentions Trump it is effectively a ban on most AP2 articles. As that was not the ban imposed it is not reasonable to assume it was the intention.</p>
<p>Had a non-partisan editor or administrator suggested I remove the comment I would have. In fact earlier today I unintentionally violated the topic ban, which I caught and reverted, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:GoldenRing#Topic_ban" title="User talk:GoldenRing">asking the administrator who imposed the ban</a> for clarification precisely to avoid these issues. <a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J.

<p>@Aquillion: It is disputed. Again from our article "mentions of Trump have mostly been scrubbed from [the group's] rhetoric." My interest is because they are a pro-speech group. For the same reason I have edited <a href="/wiki/The_Evergreen_State_College" title="The Evergreen State College">The Evergreen State College</a>, <a href="/wiki/2017_Berkeley_protests" title="2017 Berkeley protests">2017 Berkeley protests</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber" title="Google's Ideological Echo Chamber">Google's Ideological Echo Chamber</a>, <a href="/wiki/BAMN" title="BAMN">BAMN</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gab_(social_network)" title="Gab (social network)">Gab (social network)</a>.</p>
<p>@BMK: Re: "if the edit were a violation" If I say "no" someone else says "yes" who is right? If the "yes" came from an admin or even a disinterested editor I would have accepted it. The question is whether it was reasonable for me to assume the scope includes this article given the specificity of the ban (Trump) and the insignificant difference in effect between that ban and an AP2 ban if it is interpreted this broadly.</p>
<p>@Masem: I do not see how in a sanction here would be preventative rather than punitive. I attempted to clarify the scope of the topic ban with <a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">GoldenRing</a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Diff/812960169" title="Special:Diff/812960169">hours</a> before that edit to determine whether the scope should be interpreted so broadly. Whatever the decision I would have respected it. A simple clarification from GoldenRing will be 100% "preventative." <a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J. Lambden">James J.

<p>Three (obvious) points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topic bans pertain to all pages on Wikipedia, including talk pages;</li>
<li>The ban against editing about Trump is to be "broadly construed" and since "mentions of Trump have mostly been scrubbed from [the group's] rhetoric" it most have once been <i><b>in</b></i> their rhetoric, which makes them connected to Trunp as far as the "broadly construed" standard is concerned;</li>
<li>That JJL would have reverted the edit if a "non-partisan" editor had asked, but would not do so for someone he considers to be partisan simply indicates that he does not understand the nature of the topic ban: if the edit was a violation, it was a violation <i><b>period</b></i>, no matter <i><b>who</b></i> brought it to his attention. <a href="/wiki/User:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User:Beyond My Ken">Beyond My Ken</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User talk:Beyond My Ken">talk</a>) 06:39, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Aquillion">Statement by Aquillion</span></h4>
<p>Just as a note, the group's association with Trump is not disputed. Just looking at the discussion that Lambden linked above makes that obvious; the dispute was not over whether the group's primary activity was pro-Trump rallies (all versions described their pro-Trump position prominently within the first or second sentence) - the dispute was over whether they stood for <i>anything else at all</i>. But organizing pro-Trump rallies is their primary activity (and this has been prominent in every stable version of the lead, as well as detailed in the article itself); James J. Lambden knows this, having edited the article for a while. I think, given the fact that James J. Lambden's user page consists (as of this writing) solely of a giant picture of Trump, it is reasonable to conclude that the fact that the group primarily organizes pro-Trump rallies is his main reason for editing the page. --<a href="/wiki/User:Aquillion" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Aquillion" title="User talk:Aquillion">talk</a>) 06:37, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<li>Taking the usual meaning for "broadly construed", I cannot see how Patriot Prayer can be consider outside the "broadly construed" topic area around Trump, given the group was formed in response to reactions to pro-Trump activists. "Broadly construed" in nearly every Arbcom case has been taken that one should be using extreme caution and keep a far distance from what could be considered close to the warned off topic area to avoid potential admin/AE action. Yes, this might mean that most pages on post-2015 topics that would fall under AP2 are offlimits at this point to JJL under these terms.

<dt>Additional comments by editor filing complaint&#160;</dt>
</dl>
<p>1. Note that initially I thought DHeyward only violated 1RR because he just popped up on my watchlist twice in quick succession. Feeling nice and assuming good faith I asked him to self-revert <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DHeyward&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=813005608">[9]</a>. Only then did I actually look at the history and realized that he's pretty much started a full out edit war by reverting FOUR times on a ONE revert restricted article. In response to my courtesy request for self-revert (which was not required on my part) Dheyward decided to get cute. He did revert but... to his initial preferred version <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=813005926">[10]</a>. Basically he repeated his very first revert <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=812869879">[11]</a>, completely removing the pertinent info in the article. Note that even if there was some doubt about consensus for the material on Nov 30 10:20 (time of first revert), there was no such doubt by Dec 1, 4:52, with <a href="/wiki/User:MelanieN" title="User:MelanieN">User:MelanieN</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Objective3000" title="User:Objective3000">User:Objective3000</a> who were initially hesitant to include, changing their minds by this point. This phony self-revert looks like an attempt at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GAME">WP:GAMEing</a>. I repeated my request pointing out nature of his fake self-revert <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DHeyward#1RR">[12]</a> but he has ignored it.</p>
<p>2. The nature of the reverts itself raises serious concerns. First, there's the removal of well sourced information. Worse however, is the fact that when DHeyward realized consensus was against him and he couldn't remove the pertinent paragraph he purposefully rewrote the text to misrepresent both sources and the nature of the situation overall. In particular the text is about the fact that a woman, most likely associated with the organization <a href="/wiki/Project_Veritas" class="mw-redirect" title="Project Veritas">Project Veritas</a>, came to the Washington Post with a phony story about how Roy Moore got her pregnant. But the whole thing was a setup and an attempt to trick WaPo into publishing something false. Of course WaPo smelled something fishy, investigated, and exposed the scheme. This is what happened and what reliable sources happened. So how did DHeyward write it up? Well <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=812983115">as can be seen</a> he wrote it to make it seem like this was "just another false allegation against Roy Moore". He did this by removing or minimizing the pertinent context of the whole thing being a set up. He basically portrayed it as something opposite of what actually happened. This is a clear case of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGENDA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGENDA">WP:AGENDA</a> editing and done pretty deceptively at that. This isn't an isolated instance of such behavior; the same was noted just few days ago in the WP:AE request above concerning <a href="/wiki/User:Anythingyouwant" title="User:Anythingyouwant">User:Anythingyouwant</a>, by <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">User:Drmies</a> - <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=812365365">[13]</a>, <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=812391693">[14]</a></p>
<p>Since the nature of the violation is quite egregious (4 reverts on 1RR article, sneaky manipulation) a broad topic ban is in order.</p>
<p>@Masem - the "agenda" charge isn't really about Roy Moore though. It's about how DHeyward rewrote "Project Veritas tried to trick Washington Post into publishing a false story" as "a woman made false accusations against Roy Moore". I mean, yeah, she did. But she didn't do it to hurt Moore, she did it to try and discredit the women who have come out with their stories. Since these women are also "living people" in this instance the BLP (aside from the AGENDA misrepresentation) would apply the other way.<small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Volunteer_Marek" title="User:Volunteer Marek"><font style="color:orange;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;"><b>&#160;Volunteer Marek&#160;</b></font></a></span></small> 19:15, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_DHeyward">Statement by DHeyward</span></h4>
<p>I apologize for edit warring. That was not necessary.</p>
<p>I will raise some issues though. First, Volunteer Marek I believe is under a topic ban for articles related to Donald Trump. Trump is listed in the lead of the article in question. Trump has also stated that he believes Moore and not the women who have made complaints. This article is certainly within the broadly construed meaning of his topic ban and had he adhered to his topic ban, the collegial atmosphere of continuous editing editing would have continued just like this edit shows<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=812985254&amp;oldid=812983690">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>Second, there are not four reverts as Volunter Marek has exagerated. The links listed show the original rewrite (<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=812983115">1:18 December 1</a>) which is not a revert. The third on his list (<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=813002167">[17]</a>) was removing the "raped" allegation that VM pointed out in his edit. There are 2 reverts which is a violation of 1RR. The last revert was to a condition prior the version VM prefers. There was no way to satisfy both 1RR and CONSENSUS. VM pretends his version has consensus when in fact the only discussion is about the event.</p>
<p>MrX who commented below has also violated 1RR with these edits.</p>
<ol>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=812881805&amp;oldid=812869879">MrX restored contested material</a></li>
<li><a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=813084332&amp;oldid=813005926">MrX again restores contested material</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a statement that he says has strong consensus to add, no other editors seemed compelled to do it and he had to violate 1RR to get it.</p>
<p>Volunteer Marek provides a random collection of links implying there are related blocks that are relevant. None of those links are related to AP2. It was very deceitful to list any of those links as relevant here. He is mud slinging in an attempt at overreach.</p>
<p>As for AGENDA, just review my edit. I described the false accusation as it relates to Roy Moore and sexual abuse allegations. That is essentially the topic of the article (see article Title). I did not remove any any relevant material and also argued that its nature makes it a poor fit here. Volunteer Mareks edit comment is very telling. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=812998599&amp;oldid=812997266">[18]</a>. WM states <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">it makes it seem like some woman falsely accused Moore of something. The actual story is that (Project Veritas) and this woman purposefully tried to trick WaPo</span>. If VM believes that the event was not an accusation of sexual abuse against Roy Moore and instead was between Project Veritas and WaPo, why is he pushing his personal narrative in an article that is not about Washington Post or Project Veritas? It is certainly not necessary to try to implicate Roy Moore in the deception played on WaPo which is a clear BLP violation and COATRACK violation.

<p>I apologize for edit warring. I'm don't believe a block is necessary and certainly not any AE sanction.</p>
<p>If a sanction is deemed necessary then VM should be sanctioned for violating his Trump Topic ban levied only a few weeks ago and violating the consensus requirement as well as pushing unrelated an unsubstantiated claims into an article with sensitive BLP concerns. MrX also violated 1RR as shown above. I'd prefer just not to have any action against anyone. --<a href="/wiki/User:DHeyward" title="User:DHeyward">DHeyward</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DHeyward" title="User talk:DHeyward">talk</a>) 23:59, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

Under what evidence are you basing the "all living American politicians" sanction? This article and the edits were not about a living politician.

<p>@Volunteer Marek states: <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">It's about how DHeyward rewrote "Project Veritas tried to trick Washington Post into publishing a false story" as "a woman made false accusations against Roy Moore".</span> Of course! The article is ABOUT sexual abuse allegations against Roy Moore. It's not a COATRACK for anything else. It's your AGENDA that you are pushing that makes it seem to you that other stuff should be added. There is certainly no consensus to decorate the article with information not relevant to it's scope. I mentioned PV and WP in the paragraph but for this article it's a sidelight. The PV article is a better place. --<a href="/wiki/User:DHeyward" title="User:DHeyward">DHeyward</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DHeyward" title="User talk:DHeyward">talk</a>) 00:25, 2 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>I concur with Volunteer Marek's comments. The first diff is an attempt by DHeyward to defy firm consensus, and the first revert of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=812502316&amp;oldid=812485022">this edit</a> made two days earlier. <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=813005926&amp;oldid=813003011">This edit</a> is an unambiguous and brazen violation of the 1RR restriction, in addition to being a second violation of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CONSENSUS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a>.

<li>Meh... if MONGO can't see the obvious talk page consensus that everyone else sees, I guess that's his shortfall.

<p>This is an obvious 1RR violation, documented by diffs, with no relevant exemptions. It should be dealt with expeditiously. The idea behind discretionary sanctions is to make it <i>easier</i> and more efficient to deal with disruptive editing, so it's ironic and counterproductive when these sorts of obvious, straightforward cases become needlessly complicated as a result of the WP:AE mechanism. If an admin saw this case at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ANEW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ANEW">WP:ANEW</a>, they'd block and move on. I'm not clear why we allow AE to hinder the speedy resolution of basic conduct issues on the articles that need it most.</p>
<p>The 1RR violation is compounded by the "self-revert", which was nothing of the sort; it was dishonest gamesmanship, as pointed out above. I think a standard block for edit-warring would be appropriate, and would personally advocate a topic ban (at least a time-limited one) given the bad faith described above.</p>
<p>(I'm commenting here as an editor, not as an admin, because I have recently been involved in a discussion with DHeyward on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS/N" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS/N">WP:RS/N</a> about sourcing questions on the Moore article. While I'm not convinced that noticeboard input necessarily creates <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:INVOLVED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:INVOLVED">"involvement"</a>, I'm commenting here, rather than below, to avoid sidetracking this clear-cut case any further). <b><a href="/wiki/User:MastCell" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a></b>&#160;<sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:MastCell" title="User talk:MastCell">Talk</a></sup> 22:40, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

I do consider DHeyward aware, however, for the purposes of the enforcement procedures, as the previous case was so closely related to this topic area. I'd like to hear their comments before taking any action. My initial thoughts are between 0RR on all living American politicians and related subjects, broadly construed, and a topic ban on living American politicians and related subjects, broadly construed. I'd like to hear others thoughts (both admins and non-admins), before taking any action, however. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 14:29, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>While in light of a standalone article, I agree that the edits by DHeyward are seemingly improper given the various restrictions. That said, with VM bringing up <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGENDA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGENDA">WP:AGENDA</a>, the fact we have a spin off from a BLP, with this much depth of very recent accusations (yet proven out in court) so close to the event is very much against the spirit of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT#NEWS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT#NEWS</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RECENTISM" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RECENTISM">WP:RECENTISM</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BLP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and others. I know the article had been through AFD and kept despite these points, so since we have it now, we need to recognize that because this article is going to focus principally on negative aspects related to the allegations made towards Moore that are still being evaluated in primary sources, claiming editors having an AGENDA on this specific article is a bit of a bullshit statement since the article already is established to have an agenda from external sources. We need people to be watchdogs to make sure it stays in the bounds of BLP, NPOV, and the like - enforcing those is not agenda-driven. I don't think DHeyward's edits are all appropriate given broader issues of AP2, but I think that there's several other issues at play here that DHeyward's intentions are perfectly in line with how we should be treating this article (just not the editing pattern). I agree with the statement that trying to coatrack complaints towards Project Veritas here that DHeyward was trying to remove is inappropriate. Calling out DHeyward's actions as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGENDA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGENDA">WP:AGENDA</a> is completely out of line, but they did cross the line in terms of edit warring and that does need to be dealt with. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 15:20, 1 December 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Marek, when I read though the WaPost source, and the edits on that section between DHeyward and others, I see DHeyward's attempting to write the situation in a more cautious voice with respect to BLP given the nature of how the WaPost report makes numerous connections (possibly true, but not yet established as such), as well as the revelancy to Moore's own character. Nothing that I can find says this woman was trying to discredit the other victims, that seems to be reading between the lines, which frequently happens when there is a agenda being pushed by the media with a view that an editor might share themselves. DHeyward was trying properly to tone down that section.<br />
That said, how much of a BLP problem was it? Not to the level that the edit-warring exceptions would allow for, and the fact there was ongoing talk page discussions that DHeyward was participating in at the same time makes the edit warring a bit more obvious, so I would support a short term block. However, I cannot at all agree it was agenda pushing, if anything, it was pushing back against a source that is clearly dependent here and has an agenda, as to keep BLP issues to a minimum. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 22:41, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<p>On June 29, 2017, Archwayh opens a discussion related to American politics with JFG.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JFG&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=788020355">[22]</a> When JFG informs Archwayh that they may be violating their topic ban, they claim that the topic ban "has nothing to do w/ page talk".<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:JFG&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=788042428">[23]</a></p>
<p>On October 10 and October 26 they make edits which to me appear to be perfectly fine, except that the edit summary refers to American politics.</p>
<p>Rest of the evidence should speak for itself (edits about post-1932 politics of the United States, edits to pages about US politics, or closely related people).</p>
<p>It seems obvious that Archwayh doesn't understand what they were topic banned from (and why), and I'm not convinced they will. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Politrukki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Politrukki (page does not exist)">Politrukki</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Politrukki" title="User talk:Politrukki">talk</a>) 17:29, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Archwayh">Statement by Archwayh</span></h4>
<p>I have not made any edit directly related to politics, or thous as such that could be debated as political-oriented &amp; then be removed. And re: Bloomberg, that was a FIX to an error that should be applauded. That wasn't a political-motivated change or ad, but a FIX. The minor edit on Bush was related to small grimmer fix -- not some controversial or political-oriented one. If I didn't understand these term, then I obviously apologize. But, inn essence, this is a complete lie by a user who is conducting a political witch hunt against me, bc he doesn't like my views (and for COL, I am a moderate centrist &amp; not some ideologue who pushed agenda in Wiki. All of these attacks against me were * being perused by this obsessed user, who's fixated on me for some reason. To contrast, he he is a right-wing ideologue who supports Ted Cruz, from what I know). If he won't stop, I plan to peruse other options to stop him from smearing me. I am planning to file a complaint about his alleged corrupt behavior later on. Edits that have been on some figures that may be political aren't related directly to politics, and they were commonly agreed or small fixes. Further, most edits were on user PAGES, and didn't even influenced Wikipedia. This user, that continues this obsessive witch hint, will hear from me. If I edited something that doesn't directly relates to politics, but could be perceived as such -- then I am obviously sorry. But I didn't violate anything at least knowingly, &amp; my small number of edits were small, non-political &amp; commonly agreed. That's my statement <a href="/wiki/User:Archwayh" title="User:Archwayh">Archway</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Archwayh" title="User talk:Archwayh">talk</a>) 17:37, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would tend to be lenient about occasional chit-chat about politics on a user talk page, as happened on mine a few months ago. However we cannot accept blatant requests for other people to edit by proxy on behalf of the TBANned editor. Either this is bad faith or <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CIR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CIR">gross incompetence</a>. In both cases, a harsher sanction is warranted, perhaps a 6-month block with the usual avenues to get unblocked and return to collegial editing within the project's rules. — <a href="/wiki/User:JFG" title="User:JFG">JFG</a> <sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:JFG" title="User talk:JFG">talk</a></sup> 18:19, 1 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh boy. The user has participated in recent threads concerning the sanction. For example <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement#Anythingyouwant">[34]</a>. Indeed, the editor is currently agitating one of the admins active on this page <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GoldenRing#A_bit_of_clarity,_please....">[35]</a> over this very sanction.</p>

<p>In addition to a straight up violation of the discretionary sanctions, the user also makes frequent personal attacks and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ASPERSIONS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ASPERSIONS">WP:ASPERSIONS</a> against others, as evidenced on <a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">User:GoldenRing</a>'s talk page. For example, referring to others as <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldenRing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=813705529">"POV warriors"</a>. According to them anyone who disagrees with them is a "POV warrior". This is coupled with insistence on using non-reliable, and fringe sources, including conspiracy and hoax sites while at the same time arguing that standard, reliable, mainstream sources are "fringe", should not be trusted and used. Basically they got it exactly backwards. This kind of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND">WP:BATTLEGROUND</a> attitude, especially the repeated insults and name calling has made it impossible to work collaboratively with Atsme, which is why most editors have taken to just ignoring them on the talk page.</p>
<p>I am NOT under any TB from the Roy Moore article and I did NOT make a "revert while under TB". Atsme knows this because they have participated in recent discussions where this was brought up. Even if Atsme did not know this for sure, the proper thing to do would've been to ask or inquire, rather than edit war and violate DS by reverting. The excuse offered below is lame and false.<small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Volunteer_Marek" title="User:Volunteer Marek"><font style="color:orange;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;"><b>&#160;Volunteer Marek&#160;</b></font></a></span></small> 21:51, 4 December 2017 (UTC) (GoldenRing has explicitly stated, in the same place where Atsme is commenting: <i>" I wouldn't consider Roy Moore covered by it (the topic ban - VM)"</i></p>

The admin placing the restriction explicitly stated that edits about Roy Moore which are not explicit about Trump are not covered. Neither is the DT topic ban "broadly construed" and the diff you provide does NOT show that (in fact the diff you provide - <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Volunteer_Marek&amp;diff=810809169&amp;oldid=810777353">[37]</a> - is about an appeal of an IBAN... are you confused?). Please strike your false statements. And look, this is a straight up violation of a discretionary sanction by Atsme. A discretionary sanction that Atsme was very well aware of. A discretionary sanction that Atsme tried to get OTHER editors sanctioned under. Yet violated themselves. This is a pretty clear cut case, exactly the same as the one which recently other editors have been sanctioned under. "Friendship" or no, editors need to be treated fairly and equally.<small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Volunteer_Marek" title="User:Volunteer Marek"><font style="color:orange;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;"><b>&#160;Volunteer Marek&#160;</b></font></a></span></small> 23:00, 4 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

I requested clarification from GoldenRing, and since there is such a gray area, the ambiguities need to be clarified or WP will end-up with far fewer active editors. Also, there is not a notice of the consensus sanction in the edit view which creates a major issue - it's on the TP which is relatively obscure from editors who are busy building an encyclopedia, and who are not interested in playing politics.

<dd>So, here come the pile-ons as predicted - I could've named the editors one by one and they did not disappoint. Oh, well...back on point - GoldenRing issued the following <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_enforcement_log/2017&amp;diff=810457138&amp;oldid=809847745">AE warning</a>: <span class="example good-example" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #006400;">James J.

Then we have the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=813036743&amp;oldid=813035512">block by Golden Ring</a> against <a href="/wiki/User:James_J._Lambden" title="User:James J.

While the block created a bit of confusion, I can't fault GoldenRing for doing what he believed was the right thing to do. Now <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> is here defending VM with the argument: "Oh, I disagree that Moore falls under any Trump-ban construction". Drmies, with all due respect, where were you and all the others who are here now attempting to defend VM against a revert I made in GF thinking he was TB from Trump broadly construed when the first Trump-ban construction was on the auction block, and James J. Lambden came through the sale ring? <sup>Pause to draw a deep breath after that long-winded text.</sup> It appears to me that the precedent was established with <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=813036743&amp;oldid=813035512">this edit</a> to a TP, and resulted in a 48 hr. block for James J. Lambden. If a TP edit resulted in a block for that editor, what makes VM immune for his <b>TWO</b> blatantly obvious Trump-related edits broadly construed - not counting the numerous others he made at the Moore AfD? Moore and Trump are inseparable - Trump supports Moore, is campaigning for Moore, and Moore talks about Trump and is following Trump's agenda. Some are foolish enough to believe Trump may help the guy get elected, but that's neither here nor there. Forget the politics - we're talking WP TOPIC BANS. GoldenRing and Masem have both faithfully executed their duties as admins, and have clearly maintained NPOV and followed WP:PAGs without any apparent COI, yet <s>they</s> Masem is being asked to recuse themselves from this case. What?!! I can't even begin to describe my dismay. <s>But I have to follow-up with the COI aspect and the unwarranted recuse requests, and ask if you have any COI regarding candidate Roy Moore who is running for the Alabama State Senate, and if you approve of VM's edits?</s> <sup>struck that stupid question and apologize - I deplore such petty antics and should've picked a better scenario to demonstrate how it makes one feel to be accused when innocent.04:02, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</sup> I have nothing to hide - I'm not voting in that election, I'm a Texas/Bonaire resident who suffers from voter identity disorder and my butt cheeks hurt from sitting on the fence for as long as I can remember (long term being far greater than short term but I can still smell <a href="/wiki/Peanut_butter_test" title="Peanut butter test">peanut butter</a>).

<p>With a keg of dots and a predilection of connecting them, I suppose you can consider “broadly construed” as meaning anything. I think considering VM’s revert within the scope of the TBan is a bridge too far. I do think that the reinstatement by Atsme after 23 minutes clearly violated 1RR as stipulated on the article talk. Now, Atsme claims to have not seen the consensus clause of the DS warning. I accept that and merely reverted what I believed to be a DS violation with a polite note in the edit summary as opposed to taking it to AE or article talk. What bothers me is that Atsme then went to an admin talk and made repeated accusations against other editors without notifying them. What’s the point of such? Atsme’s actions simply don’t appear to be of a collaborative nature. <a href="/wiki/User:Objective3000" title="User:Objective3000">O3000</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Objective3000" title="User talk:Objective3000">talk</a>) 23:50, 4 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two points. First, I find it hard to believe that a topic ban from Trump-related articles, even broadly construed, can be considered to cover an edit about an opinion poll regarding a candidate for Senate. Was VM's topic ban actually intended to cover everything to do with current politics? Or maybe everything to do with Republican politics? Or everything and everyone on which Trump has ever expressed an opinion? If so, the decision should have said so - but the <a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">admin who imposed the ban</a> does not interpret it that way.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldenRing&amp;diff=813617090&amp;oldid=813497491">[40]</a> Second, all of the discussion so far has been about VM and whether he violated his topic ban. Will there be any discussion about the subject of this report, Atsme - specifically the restoration of challenged material immediately after it had been challenged? I know that it is permitted, in cases of vandalism and BLP violations, to ignore the DS rules about reverts and restoration; is there also an exemption for cases in which a party believes the other party to be topic banned? In other words, if the TBAN actually did apply to VM, would that make it OK for Atsme to revert his challenge? Also, will there be any discussion about the personal attacks and battleground mentality cited here? (Disclaimer: I am <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:INVOLVED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:INVOLVED">WP:INVOLVED</a> at the Roy Moore article, although I had nothing to do with the edits cited here or the discussion about them.) --<a href="/wiki/User:MelanieN" title="User:MelanieN">MelanieN</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:MelanieN" title="User talk:MelanieN">talk</a>) 00:01, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

It really isn't clear whether you are saying the sentence should be in the article, or shouldn't be in the article. Or are you trying to say that adding it, or removing it, is justified by BLP?

<p>I concur with the above commenters who don't think the "personal attacks" rise to the level of being actionable. VM is unhappy with Atsme, oh well. This is a controversial current event topic and emotions run high. There were not egregious policy violations here, so move on. On the other side, there is a large gray area about the details of VM's TBAN as well as the interpretation of DS as applied to this article, but he probably would benefit from clarification on that point. The appropriate response here is to explain equally to both parties what does and does not fit existing restrictions and how both parties are expected to proceed from here forward on this article and related topics.

<p>I don't keep up with politics topics on Wikipedia, so I'll defer to others with familiarity on Volunteer Marek's topic ban, but it looks like at first glance it might be stretch of the topic ban to claim it was violated from what I've seen (though I'll let others dig on that).</p>
<p>I mostly am commenting here because VM mentioned they didn't look up previous sanctions. A lot of users have been dealing with exactly the same behavior from Atsme that VM described on the battleground mentality. Those of us who frequent the fringe noticeboard are especially familiar with Atsme (one previous sanction was being banned from <a href="/wiki/Kombucha" title="Kombucha">Kombucha</a> for edit warring).<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Atsme&amp;oldid=668691217#Notice_that_you_are_now_subject_to_an_arbitration_enforcement_sanction">[43]</a> The snark and battleground behavior often directed at editors on article talk pages has previously caught the community's attention regarding BLP issues<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive833#Atsme_and_BLP_violations">[44]</a> and pursuing editors on noticeboards, etc. with vexatious claims like the claim of VM's topic ban here appears to be. Part of that pursuit of editors resulted in a block by <a href="/wiki/User:Bishonen" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive894#Vandal-like_disruption,_aspersions_and_PAs_at_WP:AVDUCK">[45]</a> where a site ban or noticeboard ban was also warned as a likely next step if not justified already.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=674831530#Atsme_blocked">[46]</a>.</p>
<p>Bishonen also recently warned Atsme of a topic-ban in American politics if their behavior kept up back in August.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Atsme/Archive_19#Please_note_warning">[47]</a>. The "popcorn" comments on this board<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement&amp;diff=813715045&amp;oldid=813714185">[48]</a> seem to indicate the snark and battleground mentality still permeates Atsme's interactions with editors. It's concerning that someone is bringing up these same issues again with Atsme in a controversial topic like politics when they are already on a short <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ROPE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ROPE">WP:ROPE</a>, but it's pretty much the same stuff we've been dealing with in the past for other series of topics whenever Atsme's behavior finally gets brought up at admin boards each time. They usually seem to lash out at editors and admins<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Atsme/Archive_19#Please_note_warning">[49]</a> that try to warn them about this too and pursue that same battleground mentality, so regardless of the question of Volunteer Marek, Atsme's behavior does need a look considering the history. If VM's posts were squarely not a violation of the topic ban, then that would be more vexatious use of admin boards by Atsme that they've been boomeranged for before. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingofaces43" title="User:Kingofaces43">Kingofaces43</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingofaces43" title="User talk:Kingofaces43">talk</a>) 01:22, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>VM's edit should not be considered topic ban violation - if Goldenring wanted to topic ban VM from American politics more generally, they could (and should) have. But they didn't, and they have even commented <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldenRing&amp;diff=813617090&amp;oldid=813497491">here</a> (in response to Atsme's own request for clarification) that the ban should not be interpreted that broadly:</p>
<p><span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">For a ban from Trump, I don't seem to interpret it as widely as some; I don't think a ban from Trump is effectively a ban from post-2015 American politics. It's worth noting the phrasing of the ban, too - "articles and edits" - which is meant to say that some articles may not themselves be about Trump but individual edits on those articles may still be - so the ban is not from <a href="/wiki/Sean_Hannity" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> but any edits made to that article that could be reasonably construed to concern Trump would be violations.</span></p>
<p>I note that Tony has recused themselves here - it might be worth noting that Masem and Atsme have been the two most vocal proponents of a rather strict (and extremely contentious) interpretation of policy in a number of recent politics-related discussions: <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Michel_Chossudovsky">[50]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Use_of_the_term_%22far-right%22_to_describe_a_BLP">[51]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jared_Taylor#RfC_labeling_in_lede">[52]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard#Pardon_of_Joe_Arpaio">[53]</a> to the point where Atsme is writing <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Atsme/sandbox&amp;oldid=812908796">a rather one-sided essay</a> about the topic that is made up largely of quotes <i>by</i> Masem, and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Masem&amp;diff=811360929&amp;oldid=809427213">has asked</a> him for for backup on contentious American politics articles.

<p>I recommend a warning to both editors for battleground behavior, but no action against either at this time because we've got too many mitigating factors: (1) The topic ban notice on Marek's talk page does not say "broadly construed"; (2) Atsme only made one revert, and even that possibly on the theory that Marek had violated his TBan; (3) The matter of whether Roy Moore comes under any Trump rubric, broadly construed or not, is solely a matter of opinion, and the boundaries obviously need to be spelled out to him by somebody; (4) At least four if not five experienced editors have asked <a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> to recuse and to instead opine as a commenter; (5) The material VM deleted was a quote of a poll, not a BLP-vio. I think Lankiveil nailed it when he said "I'm seeing a clear battleground mentality from both participants here." I don't know how to resolve that part; Marek is already under a temporary TBan. I think they both need a warning to desist from any direct or indirect personal comments about the other (or indeed about other editors, period, except at ANI or AE), and to stick to discussing edits, content, policies, and guidelines. I believe they may eventually end up with an IBan if they fail to adhere to that. <a href="/wiki/User:Softlavender" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Softlavender" title="User talk:Softlavender">talk</a>) 06:44, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pardon me if the following is an evaluation without evidence, but Atsme is a diehard tendentious POV editor in many areas, most recently American Politics. She's generally civil and occasionally charming, especially to Admins, which has served her well. It's gotten her a free pass over and over. In general, however, she denies the validity of mainstream sources, which is fine -- good for her, but it doesn't work on Wikipedia. She crusades <i>against</i> mainstream-sourced content based on a kaleidoscopic array of illogical assertions that the mainstream is biased. She has plenty of weird interpretations of content, wing-nut stuff like on <a href="/wiki/G._Edward_Griffin" title="G. Edward Griffin">G. Edward Griffin</a>, and she distorts policy to prolong talk-page disputes long after her views have been rejected. Anyway, feel free to hat this statement-w/o-diffs or ask for diffs if either is appropriate. My point is that there's plenty of context for this false charge that VM violated the TBAN, and we'd all be much more productive without Atsme editing in American Politics. <a href="/wiki/User:SPECIFICO" title="User:SPECIFICO"><font color="#0011FF"><b>SPECIFICO</b></font></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:SPECIFICO" title="User talk:SPECIFICO"><i>talk</i></a> 02:00, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</p>

<p>Trump is currently mentioned twice in the lede and at least one more time later. It may be a stretch to say this is not intertwined with Trump but not a long stretch. Looks like VM is hoping to rid himself of all opposition by expecting a very strict application of the sanctions be applied to others, but expecting everyone to grant him the benefit of the doubt. Based on my interchanges with him, I'd have to say his behavior is as bad a battlefield one in this arena as any I have encountered lately.

The man story in virtually all news outlets today is Trump's endorsement of Moore.

That said, Atsme may also be goading a bit here - while edits from banned editors can be undone without reason, in a area that is under DS, I would be extremely careful using this as a means to justify the second revert, and for that, this might need a simple short term block as with DHeyward above. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 22:19, 4 December 2017 (UTC)</s>

If Trump simply had backed Moore and no one in the media blinked and we simply included this fact, I would agree that that wouldn't be sufficient to be included in a broadly construed Trump topic ban. But Trump and Moore have been strongly linked by the media, making this topic definitely Trump-related, if we follow how "broadly construed" should be taken in the past. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 00:17, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</s>
<ul>
<li>I will point out that while VM's talk page message and the log are missing "broadly construed", it <i>is</i> in the message GoldenRing used to close the AE here <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive220" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive220">Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive220</a> (see the second VM request, 15 Nov).

If GoldenRing did <b>not</b> mean "broadly construed", then consider my issues regarding VM's actions nullified, my apologies to VM, and still express concern on Astme's actions. If GoldenRing did mean "broadly construed" and just forgot that language, then my issue still stands (at least, in my opionion, that the Moore accusation article falls within that topic area) --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 05:19, 5 December 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>VM, It would be helpful to point to the diff that GoldenRing said that (I don't see it in any place obvious), but I will assume that is verbatim, so if they think Moore is not covered (more specifically the Moore accusation article), then I strike my issues on the TBAN covering that and apologize for that. I will still state that all around, I'm seeing a bunch of battleground behavior on all sides that still isn't good here and indicative of the larger problems related to AP2 over the last few years (beyond the scope of this). I still think that Atsme reversion before discussion is a problem, no question, but I also think that <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=813670961">their addition</a> that was reverted is potentially appropriate material for the article (but that's a content debate) and automatic removal by VM doesn't help towards a collaborative atmosphere. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 06:36, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>I consider Atsme a friend, and as such INVOLVED with her, so I am <b>recusing</b> on this even though I placed the original sanctions on the article. Also, a note that it is technically under BLP sanctions, not AP2, though if that is causing confusion and there is consensus here to move it to AP2, I have no objection. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 22:35, 4 December 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree that Roy Moore, and specifically the recent controversy around sexual abuse allegations, fall under the Donald Trump topic if broadly construed, given that Trump has repeatedly inserted himself into the controversy. That being said, <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldenRing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=813712201">this</a> is also a thoroughly unimpressive contribution from Atsme. I'm seeing a clear battleground mentality from both participants here. <a href="/wiki/User:Lankiveil" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> <sup>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lankiveil" title="User talk:Lankiveil">speak to me</a>)</sup> 01:04, 5 December 2017 (UTC).</li>
<li>Oh, I disagree that Moore falls under any Trump-ban construction--such a construction is so broad that anything Trump has tweeted about or mentioned in passing would be covered, which is just about anything. One could argue that given the Access Hollywood tape the female anatomy or lifestyles of the rich and infamous would be covered by such a topic ban. <a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">Masem</a>, sorry, but we have a spin-off article because a. no one follows NOTNEWS and b. there's a ton of coverage and it's a Big Deal. One doesn't always need Trump to make something a Big Deal... "Strongly linked by the media", I don't know what that means: is this a post-truth construction of reality? <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 01:36, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>As Tony points out, the article was placed under BLP sanctions, not AP2 or DT sanctions. On the other hand, the DS entry does not bar VM from making <i>edits</i> related to Donald Trump, it bans them <span class="example good-example" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #006400;">from all <b>articles and edits</b> related to Donald Trump</span> (emphasis added). Broadly construed, this includes all articles about subjects that are usually mentioned in connection with Donald Trump and this does imho apply to Roy Moore's sexual abuse allegations because Trump has injected himself into that scandal multiple times. So I'd be willing to AGF that Atsme thought so as well when she reverted VM for what appeared to her as a ban violation (note that she did not reinstate the edit when another editor challenged it). Her behavior afterwards however is, as Lankiveil points out, problematic.

<li>I recommend closing this with a warning to both Volunteer Marek (for violating their Trump topic ban, which arguably encompasses a politician opposed or, as here, supported by Trump); and to Atsme for battleground attitude and editing in violation of the "consensus required" restriction. The conduct reported here doesn't strike me as sufficiently serious to warrant other sanctions on either side. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein"><span style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;"><b>Sandstein</b></span></a></span></small> 10:49, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>Apologies that I have been rather absent over the past couple of days. Actually I only looked in to look up some 1st-century-BC Roman politician and my notifications had gone a bit mad. I don't have time to look into the rights and wrongs of this right now, but I'll make a few points:
<ul>
<li>I stuffed up imposing the topic bans referred to a bit. The close at AE includes the 'broadly construed' language and the log/notifications do not include it. My bad. The intention was 'broadly construed' but now individual admins enforcing the sanction will have to take a view on whether particular edits are a violation or not.</li>
<li>I would tend to agree with VM that non-Trump-related edits to Roy Moore and related articles are not a violation, though perhaps it's feeling somewhat close to the edge. If you're going to construe a topic ban <i>that</i> widely then it seems to me it's effectively a ban from all current American politics (and any historical American politics Trump happens to have commented on). If I'd meant to do that, I'd have done it and I didn't.</li>
<li>Someone will inevitably bring up my recent block of James J. Lambden for violation of the same ban. The page involved there is about an organisation which was probably formed solely to support Donald Trump (though they're now trying to broaden their interests). That makes the page Trump-related. Roy Moore is a politician in his own right with his own political campaign and his own political problems; he is not so tightly connected to Donald Trump that any edit is necessarily Trump-related, though obviously some edits may still be.</li>
<li>I had already made this explanation to Atsme <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoldenRing&amp;diff=813617090&amp;oldid=813497491">at my talk page</a> some seven hours before the edits in question, so the explanation that they thought they were reverting edits by a banned editor is a bit thin. The example used in my explanation was a different page (<a href="/wiki/Sean_Hannity" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>) but the principle is the same.</li>
<li>I haven't time to look through the history of this now, but my immediate gut reaction is that Sandstein is roughly on the money. <a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">GoldenRing</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:GoldenRing" title="User talk:GoldenRing">talk</a>) 12:29, 5 December 2017 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I'm good with doing as Sandstein has suggested. General edits on <a href="/wiki/Roy_Moore" title="Roy Moore">Roy Moore</a> that pertain to things that predate this current run for Senate are probably not under the scope, but given that Trump is a major player in the <a href="/wiki/Roy_Moore_sexual_abuse_allegations" title="Roy Moore sexual abuse allegations">Roy Moore sexual abuse allegations</a>, I can't see how it would <i>not</i> be under that scope. Trouts all around I would say. <a href="/wiki/User:Lankiveil" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> <sup>(<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Lankiveil" title="User talk:Lankiveil">speak to me</a>)</sup> 12:39, 5 December 2017 (UTC).

<p>Appealing Discretionary Sanctions is not "gaming the system." In fact, it's part of the process. Please stop threatening me with increased sanctions for following procedure. I commented on the above request because it was a) not an article and b) had direct implications to my sanctions since it was the same complaint made by the same editor. I have not edited any articles within the scope of my topic ban. Since the outcomes and findings were drastically different and Tony has stated he is friends with Atsme, I think it's fair to review his sanction with the Atsme consensus in mind.

<p>I don't believe I have exhibited BATTLEGROUND behavior despite being called a ";iar" and "gaming the system." No diffs have been provided. I've only commented on your talk page in relation to your sanction and when I was pinged - all well within the norms regarding sanctions. I gave you the courtesy of undoing your action prior to AN and prior to coming here. . That is not battleground behavior. Also, I don't see how you can call this anything but a good faith challenge given the finding above. I wouldn't be here if the finding were different. I understand you disagree with it but that doesn't change the fact that it was closed with a decision that the article in question falls under the scope of VMs topic ban. Do you not see how that finding may be relevant here considering WP:BANREVERT?

<p>DHeyward was edit warring, plain and simple, and has continually tried to game the system on this sanction and demonstrated a battleground behavior both before and after the block. There is a current appeal pending at AN where there seems to be no consensus to overturn the sanction, and he filed this while that one was pending. I disagree with the above finding and warning by Sandstein, and the fact that the administrator who imposed the topic ban (<a href="/wiki/User:GoldenRing" title="User:GoldenRing">GoldenRing</a>), does not think that Roy Moore necessarily falls within the Trump topic ban is telling. If anything, DHeyward's continued attempts to game the sanctions, including commenting on an AE action from the article that he was topic banned for originally because AE does not fall within article space in my mind shows that he is likely to continue to be disruptive and attempt to game the discretionary sanctions system. If anything, I'd support extending the topic ban. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 17:11, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I was not threatening for more sanctions because of the appeal: I have no problems with my actions being reviewed, and never have. I <i>do</i> have a problem with continued WikiLawyering to try to find every possible way to justify edit warring on a 1RR article, and the continued battleground behavior you have demonstrated towards Marek both at AN, here, and on my talk page. That is not the same as having an issue with your appealing: I don't. I have never threatened sanctions for that, and would never. Also, my friendship with Atsme would likely have me taking the exact opposite stance you are implying: she and I disagree on this point, and she thinks Marek <i>did</i> violate his TBAN. I also don't think its fair to call the Atsme ruling consensus, if you count my view, you have 3 admins commenting on both sides of the TBAN issue (Drmies, GoldenRing, me/Sandstein, Lankiveil, SoWhy), 3/4 if you count Masem as well. That's far from consensus on the topic in my mind, and I think GoldenRing has made it clear he did not intend it that way. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 17:47, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</li>
<li>The battleground behavior was with Marek, who DHeyward keeps fighting with across multiple pages, not me. Commenting on an AE action on the article that he just landed a topic ban on to continue fighting with him because the wording of the sanction combined with the behavior shown on the article seems to me to be an attempt to find ways to get around the DS system. Additionally, I'm not particularly pleased that DHeyward us misrepresenting what I said: I said <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">DHeyward also didn't seem to come to this belief that it fell within Marek's topic ban until after he was at AE.</span> This is true. None of his revert edit summaries mention BANREVERT, he never mentioned it anywhere on that article's talk page, he never raised it on Marek's talk page, and he didn't raise it when <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DHeyward&amp;oldid=813006328#1RR">Marek alerted him</a> to the 1RR. He appears to have been completely unaware of it and were just content to edit war on a 1RR article, and only came up with the justification when he was brought to AE. That is disruptive, regardless of how people view on Marek's topic ban. Additionally, as I mentioned, there is <i>not</i> consensus of administrators as to whether Marek's ban applies to Roy Moore, and even if it did, he reverted editors other than Marek, and then in self-reverting removed all the content that he objected to. I'll let other admins decide whether this is justified, but I did feel the need to respond to this since my words were being misrepresented. <a href="/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 19:20, 5 December 2017 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would not act on this appeal because it is forum-shopping. A concurrent appeal by the same user at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AN#Odd_AE_sanction_appeal" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AN">WP:AN#Odd AE sanction appeal</a> remains pending. Moreover, the reason for the appeal is unpersuasive. Every sanction is imposed for its own reason and stands or falls on its own. Because sanctions are imposed individually by different admins, they will usually not be consistent with each other, and there is no expectation in any applicable regulations that they should be. An appeal must be based on the circumstances of the sanction being appealed, not on the circumstances of another user's sanctions. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Sandstein" title="User:Sandstein"><span style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;"><b>Sandstein</b></span></a></span></small> 20:47, 5 December 2017 (UTC)
