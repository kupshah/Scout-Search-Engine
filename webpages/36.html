The stunning red soil of Vardos can be seen from space, as can its mountain ranges and oceans. But the planet’s jewel is Kestro, the capital city and Imperial hub.

Ren is an expert pilot -- thanks to skills passed down from his father -- which he puts to use in exploiting his ship's speed and ferocity. There is no other First Order craft like the TIE silencer, and it is an effective tool in Ren's mission to destroy the Resistance.</p>

Faster than the Alliance-era T-65s, Resistance X-wings are maneuverable enough to engage TIE fighters in dogfights, but powerful enough to take down capital ships. The credit-strapped Resistance relies on X-wings donated or lent by sympathetic New Republic senators and local security forces. During the assault on Starkiller Base, Poe Dameron flies a customized, dark-hulled X-wing under the call sign Black Leader.</p>

Their most distinctive feature is a pair of shapely prehensile tentacles that grow from the base of their skulls.    Few things are as graceful as a female Twi'lek in motion. This beautiful image has forever doomed generations of young Twi'leks into servitude, as the wealthy and corrupt have taken to brandishing Twi'leks as badges of prestige.    In the waning years of the Republic, the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth was represented in the Galactic Senate by the corpulent blue-skinned politician Orn Free Taa. Even a politician of high office was not above flaunting a pair of lovely Twi'lek aides as a sign of influence and wealth.</p>

Carried aboard Star Destroyers and battle stations, TIE fighters were single-pilot vehicles designed for fast-paced dogfights with Rebel X-wings and other starfighters. The iconic TIE fighter led to other models in the TIE family including the dagger-shaped TIE Interceptor and the explosive-laden TIE bomber. The terrifying roar of a TIE's engines would strike fear into the hearts of all enemies of the Empire.</p>

A quick conversion by Mon Calamari engineers turned the Profundity into the Alliance’s flagship – a modified MC75 star cruiser defended by laser cannons, torpedo launchers and a complement of starfighters.</p>

                    <p class="desc">The Ghost, piloted by the gifted Hera Syndulla, was the starship and home base of a small band of Lothal rebels. Named for its ability to travel past Imperial sensors without detection, the craft included many hidden surprises that aided the crew in their fight against the Empire. Among its many features were a 360-degree dorsal laser cannon turret, two forward laser cannons, and two rear laser cannons, as well as sleeping quarters. It also included the Phantom, a secondary shuttle that acted as a fully-armed starfighter.</p>

Ackbar realized the rebels had been drawn into a trap at Endor, but adjusted, with his fleet buying valuable time for the attack to succeed. After the Battle of Endor, Ackbar became a Grand Admiral in the New Republic, winning many victories including the pivotal Battle of Jakku. He retired to Mon Cala, but was coaxed back into service with the Resistance by Leia Organa.</p>
