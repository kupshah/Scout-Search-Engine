Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life under the New Republic has not been easy for Leia. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career have been accompanied by more personal losses.</p>

      <div class="rich_text_body rich-text-enabled"><div><br></div><p>Aboard her ambassadorial vessel, <i><a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/tantive-iv">Tantive IV</a></i>, Princess Leia Organa was custodian of stolen plans to the <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star">Death Star</a>, the <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/galactic-empire">Empire</a>’s ultimate weapon. While Leia was a member of the Imperial Senate, she was also one of the <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/rebel-alliance">Rebel Alliance</a>’s most dedicated leaders. Her ship was boarded by <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/darth-vader">Darth Vader</a> and Imperial forces, but she managed to hide the schematics and a message in the droid <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/r2-d2">R2-D2</a>, who escaped alongside his counterpart <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/c-3po">C-3PO</a>. Leia, however, was captured by <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/stormtroopers">stormtroopers</a> and confronted by Vader, who didn’t believe her claim that the ship was on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.</p><p><br></p><p>Vader and <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/tarkin">Grand Moff Tarkin</a>, one of the Empire’s highest ranking officers, held Leia prisoner on the Death Star. They sought to recover the stolen data tapes and uncover the location of the hidden Rebel base, though they knew Leia would never give up its location voluntarily. As such, Vader used an <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/interrogation-droid">interrogation droid</a> to try and extract the information, but Leia was able to resist. Tarkin, however, found another form of persuasion: he would threaten to destroy her home planet of Alderaan unless she divulged the whereabouts of the base. Reluctantly, Leia confessed that it was Dantooine; Tarkin nefariously continued with the attack, looking to display the Death Star’s might. The Princess protested, but Tarkin and Vader would not listen. Alderaan was destroyed. But the Rebels still had time -- the Dantooine base had been abandoned long ago, which Leia knew, and the Alliance really resided on <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/yavin-4">Yavin 4</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Her situation seemingly dire, events would soon unfold that would change Leia’s fate and that of the galaxy. As it turns out, the message she hid inside R2-D2 was delivered on <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/tatooine">Tatooine</a> to <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/obi-wan-kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, Jedi Master and a general in the Clone Wars who knew her father. Obi-Wan arrived on the Death Star with Luke Skywalker, <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/han-solo">Han Solo</a>, <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>, and the two droids to rescue her. Luke reached Leia’s cell first, dressed in disguise as one of the Empire’s foot soldiers. “Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?” she asked. Taking off his helmet, Luke introduced himself and the two quickly left. But by this time, stormtroopers had found the ragtag group, and Han, Chewie, Luke, and Leia were forced to jump into a trash compactor to hide. Han and Leia immediately clashed, with the Princess having little patience for his bravado. When the walls of the compactor began to close in, all seemed lost until R2-D2 was able to remotely shut them down. The group made their way back to Han’s ship, the <i><a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/millennium-falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, though Obi-Wan Kenobi fell in battle to Darth Vader. They escaped, but little did they know that Vader had placed a tracking device on their ship.</p><p><br></p><p>Leia and her rescuers rendezvoused with the Alliance on Yavin 4, where she delivered the Death Star plans. As the Rebels prepped their attack on the space station, Han and Chewie collected their reward for saving the Princess and were readying to leave. Luke and Leia were disappointed in Han’s decision, but carried on. Meanwhile, having successfully tracked the <i>Falcon</i> to Yavin 4, the Death Star closed in. The attack began, with Luke piloting an<a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/x-wing-starfighter"> X-wing</a>, Leia monitoring in the command center, and Han long gone. As the Death Star readied to destroy to Yavin 4 and the Rebel Alliance with it, Han saved Luke by blasting the <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/tie-fighter">TIE fighters</a> trailing his X-wing; Luke fired a proton torpedo into the Death Star’s exhaust port, destroying the planet-sized terror. Han, Chewie, and Luke returned to the base where Leia warmly greeted them, and later presented them medals for their bravery.</p></div>

      <div class="rich_text_body rich-text-enabled"><div><br></div><p>After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance relocated to <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/hoth">Hoth</a>, a remote ice world. Leia remained a key figure in the fight for freedom, and her feelings for Han had developed -- though he could still drive her crazy. “You stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!” she called him in a heated exchange. After the Empire discovered their location, Leia oversaw the Alliance’s evacuation and was forced to leave with Han aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.</p><p><br></p> <p>Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and C-3PO evaded the Empire by heading into an asteroid field -- a dangerous move that only the daring captain of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> would attempt. It worked, and Han docked his ship inside a cave within one of the larger rock masses. In a quiet moment, the smuggler and the Princess finally kissed -- only to be interrupted by C-3PO, who was excited to inform them that he’d isolated the ship’s reverse power flux coupling. The group later headed to <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/cloud-city">Cloud City</a>, home of Han’s old friend <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/lando-calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a>, for sanctuary. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Upon arrival, Leia was skeptical of Lando -- he seemed a little too friendly. Her misgivings would prove true, as Lando handed his new guests over to Darth Vader and <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/boba-fett">Boba Fett</a>, claiming they arrived just before the <i>Falcon</i>. Han was tortured by Vader and Leia was held prisoner, all part of a trap to lure Luke Skywalker. The Sith Lord planned to carbon-freeze Luke, but would test the dangerous procedure on Han. Before being lowered into the freezing chamber, Leia told Han that she loved him. “I know,” he replied, and was then frozen into a carbonite slab. He survived the process, and Vader demanded Leia and Chewbacca be taken to his ship. While en route, Lando took a risk and had his security forces disarm their stormtrooper escort, and led Leia, Chewie, and C-3PO in a last ditch attempt to save Han. They were too late, but managed to flee in the <i>Falcon</i>. Luke, who came to face Vader, was severely injured and only survived by reaching out through the Force to Leia. The Princess commanded they return to rescue him; while the heroes were defeated, they survived to fight another day.</p></div>

Leia, disguised as bounty hunter Boushh, brought a captive Chewbacca before <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/jabba-the-hutt">Jabba</a>. She collected a bounty of 35,000 credits, and later that evening snuck quietly to Han’s carbonite slab. She unfroze the smuggler and revealed her identity to him as “someone who loves you.” They kissed and were ready to make their escape, but were interrupted by an ominous laugh; Jabba knew it was Leia the whole time. He threw Han in a cell with Chewbacca, and forced Leia to wear a slave girl outfit and remain by his side. But all was not lost. Luke appeared, and in Jabba’s botched execution of the Rebels above the <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/sarlacc">Sarlacc</a> pit, decimated the crime lord’s forces. In the ensuing chaos, Leia used the chain tethering her to Jabba to choke the giant gangster. He died in a pitiful slump, and Leia and her friends left Tatooine and headed for the stars.</p><p><br></p><p>The Princess and the others rendezvoused with the Rebel fleet and helped organize a plan to destroy the Empire’s new <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star-ii">Death Star</a>: they would head to <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/endor">Endor</a> and knock out the space station’s shield generator, while fighters would enter the super structure and take down the main reactor. Using a stolen <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/imperial-shuttle">Imperial shuttle</a>, Leia and friends landed on the forest moon but quickly encountered Imperial <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/scout-troopers">scout troopers</a>. Luke and Leia commandeered <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/speeder-bike">speeder bikes</a> and defeated the troopers in a deadly chase and battle, but were separated. The Princess, alone, encountered a strange, furry being -- an <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/ewok">Ewok</a> named <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/wicket-w-warrick">Wicket</a>. He took her to his village, where she would remain until Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo showed up as captives (Threepio was mistaken for a god by the primitive species). <br></p><p><br></p><p>After being freed, she and Luke had a private discussion away from the others where he made a startling revelation: they were actually brother and sister. Instead of shock, Leia seemed at peace. “I know,” she said. “Somehow, I’ve always known.” Luke went off to face Darth Vader, and Han and Leia led the ground assault on the shield generator. Always brave, Leia more than held her own, blasting stormtroopers left and right. While she was wounded, her injury wasn’t serious; and with help from their new furry friends, the Rebels defeated the Imperial legion of troops. The shield was destroyed, as was the Death Star and <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious">the Emperor</a>. Luke turned Vader back to the light side and reunited with Leia, Han, and their friends on Endor -- together again with the battle for freedom finally over.</p><p><br></p><h4>THE FIRST ORDER</h4></div>

                    <p class="desc">Bail Organa, a member of Alderaan's royal family and the planet's representative to the Republic Senate, earned respect on Coruscant for his honesty and his commitment to justice. Prior to the Clone Wars, Bail served alongside Senator Padmé  Amidala as a member of Chancellor Palpatine's Loyalist Committee. The two became close friends, and recruited like-minded allies to prevent Palpatine's alarming grabs for power. At the end of the war, Bail Organa adopted Padmé's daughter Leia and raised her as an Alderaanian princess. While representing Alderaan in the Imperial Senate, he worked secretly with allies such as Mon Mothma and Ahsoka Tano to assist rebel cells scattered across the galaxy, working towards the day that a unified Rebellion could emerge. Bail died when the Death Star destroyed his homeworld.</p>
